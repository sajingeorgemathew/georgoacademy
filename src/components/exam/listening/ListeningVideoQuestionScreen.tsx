// Question screen for a video discussion Listening part (EXAM-11, control
// corrected by EXAM-UI-03).
//
// Screen type 7 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, in the
// form where a whole question set is answered on one screen:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole screen
// - white exam canvas, single column, no split
// - compact instruction row at the top
// - left aligned numbered questions, each in its own block
// - a drop-down menu under each question
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// Single column, unlike the Parts 1 to 3 question screen. There is no
// question audio in this part, so there is nothing to put in a second
// column, and a split would leave half the canvas empty. Same reason
// ListeningDropdownQuestionScreen is single column.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
//
// **The control changed in EXAM-UI-03.** EXAM-11 drew eight radio groups
// here and EXAM-15F kept them, on the reading that the eight Mock Test 1
// items are whole interrogatives rather than sentence stems, so there was
// no blank for a select to sit in.
//
// That reading answered the wrong question. Part 5 is a one screen part
// answered from a drop-down menu: the source document instructs it that
// way, the part sits beside Parts 4 and 6 which are already selects, and
// eight radio groups of four options is thirty two controls stacked down a
// page a learner has to scroll several times to work through. A drop-down
// does not need a blank in the text: the question is printed whole in the
// block header and the menu under it carries the four answers. That is
// what MockTestDropdownCompletion draws when an item has a prompt rather
// than a split statement, and it is why the fix cost no content change.
//
// **Nothing about the data moved.** The eight question ids, the four
// option ids under each of them, the option wording and the answer key
// they are marked against are exactly as EXAM-11 wrote them. The value
// stored is still the option id, so a Part 5 answer chosen from a menu
// marks precisely as the same answer chosen from a radio did, on the same
// server action, against the same key.
//
// ListeningVideoQuestionList, the radio list this screen used to render,
// is gone rather than left in place unused: after the correction it was a
// second way to draw a screen that now has one.
//
// Next is gated on every question having an answer by default, which is
// what allAnswered carries. The count under the list says how many are
// left, so a learner scrolling an eight question form can see why Next is
// not available without hunting for the empty control.
//
// The full Listening route turns that gate off through requireAllAnswered
// (EXAM-15F): a window that expires has to advance whether or not the form
// is finished, and an official-style test lets a learner leave a question
// blank and take the zero for it. The individual Part 5 route keeps the
// gate, because it is a development route.
//
// The timer is real from EXAM-15D, and it belongs to the screen rather
// than to any one question on it: this part answers all eight questions in
// one window, so the window is keyed to the screen and answering a
// question does not restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision (EXAM-15F). Passing
// onTimeExpire, which the full route does and the part route does not,
// advances the flow; with no handler the reading simply becomes "Time is
// up" and the screen stays put. Either way no answer is cleared, no
// question is disabled and nothing is submitted. See
// docs/product/listening-format-strict-timing-polish.md.
