// Viewpoints question screen for a Listening part (EXAM-13, control
// corrected by EXAM-15F).
//
// Screen type 7 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, in the form
// where an incomplete statement is finished from a drop-down menu:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole screen
// - white exam canvas, single column, no split
// - compact instruction row at the top
// - left aligned numbered statements, ruled apart
// - a select under each statement
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// Single column, unlike the Parts 1 to 3 question screen. There is no
// question audio in this part, so there is nothing to put in a second
// column and a split would leave half the canvas empty. Same reason the
// dropdown and video question screens are single column.
//
// **The control changed in EXAM-15F.** EXAM-13 drew a radio group here,
// knowingly and against its own content: the six Part 6 items are sentence
// stems ending in a blank, the source document instructs the part with
// "Choose the best way to complete each statement from the drop-down menu"
// in two separate places, and the official study pack describes Parts 4 to
// 6 as sentence completion. EXAM-13 shipped radio options because its
// ticket asked for them, and dropped the drop-down clause from the
// learner-facing copy rather than naming a control that was not on the
// screen. docs/product/listening-format-audit-and-correction-plan.md
// section 8 found the mismatch and this ticket corrects it.
//
// The correction cost no content change at all. ListeningViewpointsQuestion
// already stores each statement split around its blank as textBefore and
// textAfter, exactly as ListeningDropdownQuestion does, so the two types
// are the same shape and the Part 4 list renders a Part 6 question without
// conversion. The screen therefore renders
// ListeningDropdownQuestionList directly and the separate radio list
// EXAM-13 wrote is gone: after the correction the two lists were the same
// list, and the audit asked for the duplicate to be retired rather than
// kept in step by hand.
//
// Nothing about the data moved. The six question ids, the four option ids
// under each of them and the answer key they are marked against are
// untouched, so a Part 6 answer selected from a select scores exactly as
// the same answer selected from a radio did.
//
// This screen is still separate from ListeningDropdownQuestionScreen,
// because a viewpoints part still carries its own content type and its own
// media shape. What is shared now is the question list, which is the piece
// the two formats actually have in common.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
//
// Next is gated on every question having an answer by default, which is
// what allAnswered carries, and the count under the list says how many are
// left. The full Listening route turns that gate off through
// requireAllAnswered (EXAM-15F): a window that expires has to advance
// whether or not the form is finished, and an official-style test lets a
// learner leave a question blank and take the zero. The individual Part 6
// route keeps the gate, because it is a development route.
//
// The timer belongs to the screen rather than to any one question on it:
// this part answers all six questions in one window, so the window is
// keyed to the screen and answering a question does not restart it. What
// happens at zero is the caller's decision. Passing onTimeExpire, which
// the full route does and the part route does not, advances the flow; with
// no handler the reading simply becomes "Time is up" and the screen stays
// put. Either way no answer is cleared and nothing is submitted. See
// docs/product/listening-format-strict-timing-polish.md.
