// Listening Part 6 prototype (EXAM-13, closing screens added by EXAM-14).
//
// The last Listening part, and the only one that completes statements from
// radio options. It is deliberately not merged with the Part 4 or Part 5
// prototypes: Part 4 completes the same kind of statement from a select,
// and Part 5 answers whole questions from radio options over a video. The
// content shapes differ for the same reason. See the header of
// listening-viewpoints-types.ts.
//
// What it does share with Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 is how the part closes. All
// five keep their answer key on the server and ask for it to be marked, so
// the marking state machine below is the Part 5 one, and the three closing
// screens are the same components with Part 6 wording passed in.
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildListeningViewpointsFlow
// - the answers, as { questionId: optionId }
// - the marking result, once the server has returned one
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database and a page reload starts the part again. That is deliberate for
// a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/listening-part-6-review-score.md.
//
// Part 6 has one clip and six questions, so the flow is seven screens:
// part intro, scenario, report audio, the question screen, the answer
// review, the practice score, and the end of part screen. It was five in
// EXAM-13, which closed on a single completion screen. The only change
// behind that was dropping the EXAM-13 ending from the
// buildListeningViewpointsFlow call, which now defaults to "review".
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// Answers survive going back and forward because they are keyed by
// question id rather than by screen position, and because this component
// stays mounted across the whole part. Back from the answer review lands
// on the question screen with all six options still selected, which is the
// prototype affordance the ticket asks for.
//
// Next on the question screen is disabled until all six questions have an
// answer. It is not gated on the clip finishing anywhere yet.
//
// Every screen title, statement, option and media URL comes from the
// content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1 text
// of its own. The answer key is not among them: the route strips it before
// the content reaches this component, and this component never sees a
// correct option until the learner has finished the part and the server
// sends the review rows back.

// Marks an attempt on the server and returns the review rows and the
// practice score. Resolves to null when the caller has no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
