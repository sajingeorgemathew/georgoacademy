// Full Listening section prototype (EXAM-15).
//
// The whole Listening section as one run: the section instructions, the
// Listening instructional video, Parts 1 to 6 back to back, then one
// answer review, one practice score, and the end of section screen.
//
// It replaces nothing. The six part level prototypes still exist and their
// routes are unchanged, and this component renders the same screen
// components they do, with the same content objects. What it does not
// render is their closing screens: inside the full section a part hands
// straight over to the next one, so no part level review, no part level
// score and no part level end screen appears anywhere in this flow. That
// rule is enforced one level down, in buildListeningSectionFlow, rather
// than by this component remembering not to draw them.
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildListeningSectionFlow
// - the answers for all six parts, as one { questionId: optionId } map
// - the marking result, once the server has returned one
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database, to localStorage or to a cookie, and a page reload starts the
// section again. That is deliberate for a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/full-listening-section-flow.md.
//
// One answer map carries all 38 answers because the question ids are
// unique across the six Mock Test 1 content files, so no part prefix and
// no nesting is needed. Answers survive going back and forward, and across
// a part boundary in either direction, because they are keyed by question
// id rather than by screen position and because this component stays
// mounted for the whole section. Restart clears all 38 and returns to the
// instruction screen.
//
// Strict exam behaviour (EXAM-15F). This component is where the full run
// stops being a walkthrough and starts behaving like a test, and it is the
// only place that changed: the six individual part routes render the same
// screens with none of the rules below, so they stay usable for
// development. See docs/product/listening-format-strict-timing-polish.md.
//
// Three rules, all of them props passed down rather than behaviour built
// into a screen:
//
// - **Forward only.** Back is hidden from the first screen of the run to
//   the last question screen of Part 6. A learner cannot return to a
//   previous question or a previous part, which is the published rule. The
//   two closing screens keep Back, because it is what moves between the
//   score and the review and neither of them is answerable.
// - **A window that closes moves the test on.** Every question screen is
//   handed goNext as its onTimeExpire, so reaching zero advances to the
//   next question, the next part transition or the review, exactly as
//   pressing Next would. Nothing else happens: no modal, no alert, no
//   sound, no flashing, no scroll and no focus move. The answer map is not
//   touched, so a question answered before its window closed keeps its
//   answer and a question left blank stays blank and marks as incorrect.
// - **Next never waits for an answer.** requireAnswer and
//   requireAllAnswered are false throughout the run. A gate that blocks
//   Next until every question is answered cannot survive a window that has
//   to advance regardless, and leaving a question blank and taking the
//   zero is what the official test allows.
//
// Timer durations come from listening-timing.ts, which is also where the
// working behind them is written down. Parts 1 to 3 keep the published 30
// seconds per question. Parts 4, 5 and 6 answer their whole question set
// on one screen, so each gets one window sized for that set, 3.5, 4 and 5
// minutes, with wider amber and red thresholds to match. Those three are
// derived from the published per-part allowance minus the clip, and are
// labelled as derived where they are defined.
//
// Media is asked to start on its own. The learner reached the screen by
// pressing Next, which is the user gesture a browser autoplay policy looks
// for, so the instructional video, every conversation and news clip, the
// Part 5 discussion video, the Part 6 report and each Parts 1 to 3
// question clip all attempt to play as their screen opens. A browser that
// refuses leaves the controls alone and the player prints a line saying to
// press play. No clip is muted to get around a policy and no clip is
// downloaded.
//
// Every screen title, question, option and media URL comes from the
// section content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test
// 1 text of its own. The answer keys are not among them: the route strips
// all six before the content reaches this component, and this component
// never sees a correct option until the learner has finished Part 6 and
// the server sends the review rows back.

// Marks a whole section attempt on the server and returns the per part
// review rows and the practice score. Resolves to null when the caller has
// no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
