// Native audio player for the Listening screens (EXAM-03, re-skinned by
// EXAM-UI-03).
//
// Native on purpose, for the same reasons as ExamVideoPlayer: the browser
// control set is keyboard reachable and screen reader aware, and it costs
// no dependency. No player library was installed for the exam engine, and
// none should be.
//
// Behaviour:
//
// - controls always on, so a learner can always start, pause and scrub
// - autoplay off by default. The full Listening route asks for it and the
//   internal part routes do not, so nothing on a development route starts
//   playing at a person unasked
// - preload metadata by default, so the control bar shows a real duration
//   without pulling the whole clip down
// - fallback text in two layers: the message below replaces the card body
//   when the clip fails to load, and the text inside the audio element
//   covers a browser that cannot play audio at all
//
// **What EXAM-UI-03 changed, and what it did not.** The clip now plays
// inside MockTestAudioVisual, which draws a speaker mark, a status word,
// a progress bar and the practice playbar note around the same native
// control that was always there. Nothing about playback moved: this
// component still calls play() in exactly one place, for the autoplay
// attempt EXAM-15F added, and it calls pause() and seek nowhere at all.
// The bar is driven from the element's own timeupdate event and drives
// nothing back, so it can lag the clip but it cannot disagree with it,
// and taking the visual away again would leave a working player.
//
// The three pieces of state added for it are written from media events
// rather than from an effect, which is the rule the error flag already
// followed and what the project's lint rule against setState in effects
// wants.
//
// Autoplay is an attempt and never a promise (EXAM-15F). Browser autoplay
// policies refuse a clip with sound unless the page has earned enough of a
// user gesture, and what counts differs between browsers and can be turned
// off by the person using one. So the effect calls play(), and if the
// promise it returns rejects, a short line appears under the controls
// telling the learner to press play. Nothing is muted to get around the
// policy: a muted Listening clip is worse than one that waits for a click.
//
// The play attempt is in an effect because it belongs to the clip
// appearing, not to any handler, and the screen is only ever reached by
// pressing Next, which is the gesture the policy is looking for. The
// blocked flag is set from the rejection rather than in the effect body,
// so no state is written during the effect itself.
//
// Deliberately not built yet: one time playback, and gating Next on the
// clip finishing. Both are official-style behaviours and both are listed
// as known gaps in docs/product/listening-part-1-prototype.md. onEnded is
// here so the ticket that adds the gate has somewhere to hook into
// without reworking the player.
