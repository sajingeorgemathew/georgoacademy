// Listening Part 2 prototype (EXAM-05, closing screens added by EXAM-06).
//
// Same shape as ListeningPartOnePrototype, and still deliberately not
// merged with it. Both parts now end on the answer review, the practice
// score and the end of part screen, but they get there differently: Part
// 1 marks its answers in the browser because it holds its own key, and
// Part 2 cannot, because its key never leaves the server. See markAnswers
// below.
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildListeningFlow
// - the answers, as { questionId: optionId }
// - the marking result, once the server has returned one
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database and a page reload starts the part again. That is deliberate
// for a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/listening-part-2-review-score.md.
//
// Part 2 has one conversation section, so the flow is eleven screens:
// part intro, scenario, conversation, five questions, answer review,
// practice score, end of part. No section break screen appears, because a
// break only sits before a section that is not the first.
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// Answers survive going back and forward because they are keyed by
// question id rather than by screen position.
//
// Next is disabled on a question screen until an option is selected. It
// is not gated on audio finishing anywhere in this ticket.
//
// Every screen title, bullet, option and clip URL comes from the content
// object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1 text. The
// answer key is not among them: the route strips it before the content
// reaches this component, and this component never sees a correct option
// until the learner has finished the part and the server sends the
// review rows back.

// Marks an attempt on the server and returns the review rows and the
// practice score. Resolves to null when the caller has no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
