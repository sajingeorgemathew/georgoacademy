// Listening Part 4 prototype (EXAM-09, closing screens added by EXAM-10).
//
// The first dropdown completion part. It is deliberately not merged with
// the Parts 1 to 3 prototypes: those walk one question per screen and
// gate Next on that one answer, and this one shows every question at once
// and gates Next on the whole set. The content shapes differ for the same
// reason. See the header of listening-dropdown-types.ts.
//
// What it does share with Part 2 and Part 3 is how the part closes. All
// three keep their answer key on the server and ask for it to be marked,
// so the marking state machine below is the Part 3 one, and the three
// closing screens are the same components with Part 4 wording passed in.
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildListeningDropdownFlow
// - the answers, as { questionId: optionId }
// - the marking result, once the server has returned one
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database and a page reload starts the part again. That is deliberate
// for a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/listening-part-4-review-score.md.
//
// Part 4 has one news item and five questions, so the flow is seven
// screens: part intro, scenario, news audio, the question screen, the
// answer review, the practice score, and the end of part screen. It was
// five in EXAM-09, which closed on a single completion screen. The only
// change behind that was dropping the EXAM-09 ending from the
// buildListeningDropdownFlow call, which now defaults to "review".
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// Answers survive going back and forward because they are keyed by
// question id rather than by screen position, and because this component
// stays mounted across the whole part. Back from the answer review lands
// on the question screen with all five dropdowns still set, which is the
// prototype affordance the ticket asks for.
//
// Next on the question screen is disabled until all five dropdowns have
// an answer. It is not gated on audio finishing anywhere yet.
//
// Every screen title, statement, option and clip URL comes from the
// content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1
// text. The answer key is not among them: the route strips it before the
// content reaches this component, and this component never sees a correct
// option until the learner has finished the part and the server sends the
// review rows back.

// Marks an attempt on the server and returns the review rows and the
// practice score. Resolves to null when the caller has no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
