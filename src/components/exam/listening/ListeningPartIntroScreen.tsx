// Part intro screen for a Listening part (EXAM-03).
//
// Screen type 1 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, so it is
// the EXAM-02 ExamInstructionScreen with the part content filled in
// rather than a new layout. The part name, the bullets and the counts all
// come from the content object, so this component holds no Mock Test 1
// text of its own.
//
// The intro card carries the facts a learner wants before they start: how
// many questions there are, how the part is delivered, and, for a part
// built from conversation sections, how many of those there are.
//
// EXAM-09 narrowed the content prop. It used to be ListeningPartContent,
// which meant a part had to have a sections array to have an intro
// screen. Listening Part 4 is a dropdown part and has one clip and no
// sections, so the prop is now the header fields this screen actually
// reads, which both content shapes satisfy. The section count moved out
// to its own prop for the same reason: a part that has no sections omits
// it and the row disappears rather than reading "Sections 1".
//
// No timer. The part intro screen carries no countdown.

// The part header fields this screen reads.
//
// Deliberately structural rather than a Pick of one content type, so
// ListeningPartContent and ListeningDropdownPartContent both satisfy it
// without either importing the other.
