// Listening Part 1 prototype (EXAM-03, closing screens added by EXAM-04,
// marking moved to the server by EXAM-15A).
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildListeningFlow
// - the answers, as { questionId: optionId }
// - the marking result, once the server has returned one
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database, to localStorage or to a cookie, and a page reload starts the
// part again. That is deliberate for a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/listening-part-1-prototype.md and
// docs/product/listening-part-1-review-score.md.
//
// EXAM-04 added the last three screens: answer review, practice score,
// and end of part. It calculated both in the browser, which was safe at
// the time because the Part 1 answer key was a list of pending entries
// with no correct option in it.
//
// That stopped being true once the key was transcribed, and EXAM-15A
// closed the gap. This component is now the same shape as Parts 2 to 6:
// the route strips the key before the content reaches it, so it never
// sees a correct option until the learner has finished the part and the
// server sends the review rows back. See markAnswers below.
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// Answers survive going back and forward because they are keyed by
// question id rather than by screen position.
//
// Next is disabled on a question screen until an option is selected. It
// is not gated on audio finishing anywhere in this ticket.
//
// Every screen title, bullet, option and clip URL comes from the content
// object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1 text.

// Marks an attempt on the server and returns the review rows and the
// practice score. Resolves to null when the caller has no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
