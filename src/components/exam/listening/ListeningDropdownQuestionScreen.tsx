// Dropdown completion question screen for a Listening part (EXAM-09).
//
// Screen type 7 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, and the
// screen the reference layout matters most for in this part:
//
// - grey top bar with a live "Time remaining: 00:30" countdown
// - white exam canvas, single column, no split
// - compact instruction row at the top
// - left aligned numbered statements, ruled apart
// - a dropdown under each statement
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// Single column, unlike the Parts 1 to 3 question screen. There is no
// question audio in a dropdown part, so there is nothing to put in a
// second column, and a split would leave half the canvas empty.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
//
// Next is gated on every question having an answer by default, which is
// what allAnswered carries. The count under the list says how many are
// left, so a learner scrolling a five question form can see why Next is
// not available without hunting for the empty control.
//
// The full Listening route turns that gate off through requireAllAnswered
// (EXAM-15F): a window that expires has to advance whether or not the form
// is finished, and an official-style test lets a learner leave a question
// blank and take the zero for it. The individual Part 4 route keeps the
// gate, because it is a development route.
//
// The timer is real from EXAM-15D, and it belongs to the screen rather
// than to any one question on it: this part answers all five questions in
// one window, so the window is keyed to the screen and answering a
// question does not restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision (EXAM-15F). Passing
// onTimeExpire, which the full route does and the part route does not,
// advances the flow; with no handler the reading simply becomes "Time is
// up" and the screen stays put. Either way no answer is cleared, no
// question is disabled and nothing is submitted. See
// docs/product/listening-format-strict-timing-polish.md.
