// Full Reading section prototype (EXAM-24).
//
// The whole Reading section as one run: the section intro, Parts 1 to 4
// back to back with a short transition between them, then one practice
// score over all the section's questions with the part breakdown and the
// estimated Reading band, and one answer review opened from it.
//
// It replaces nothing. The four part level prototypes still exist and
// their routes are unchanged, and this component renders the same screen
// components they do, with the same content objects. What it does not
// render is their closing screens: inside the full section a part hands
// straight over to the next one, so no part level review and no part
// level score appears anywhere in this flow. That rule is enforced one
// level down, in buildReadingSectionFlow, rather than by this component
// remembering not to draw them.
//
// It owns three pieces of state:
//
// - which screen is showing, an index into the flow built by
//   buildReadingSectionFlow
// - the answers for all four parts, as one { questionId: optionId } map
// - the marking request, idle, working, ready or failed
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database, to localStorage or to a cookie, and a page reload starts the
// section again. That is deliberate for a prototype and is recorded in
// docs/product/full-reading-section-flow-band-score.md.
//
// One answer map carries every answer because the question ids are unique
// across the four Mock Test 1 content files, reading-part-1-q1 through
// reading-part-4-q10, so no part prefix and no nesting is needed. It is
// the same { questionId: optionId } shape each part prototype already
// held, which is what lets every existing Reading helper read it
// unchanged. Answers survive going back and forward, and across a part
// boundary in either direction, because they are keyed by question id
// rather than by screen position and because this component stays mounted
// for the whole section. Restart clears them all and returns to the
// section intro.
//
// Blanks are allowed throughout and nothing is gated on them. A learner
// can finish the section with any number of questions unanswered, which
// is the EXAM-17 rule this section inherits: a blank travels as a missing
// key in the answer map, the server marks it as incorrect, and the review
// row for it says "No answer selected" while still showing the correct
// option.
//
// Timing is the part level behaviour, unchanged (EXAM-24 scope). Each
// part carries its own window, keyed to its own working screen, and no
// handler is passed for expiry: the countdown runs, reaches "Time is up",
// and stops, with every answer still selected. Nothing auto-submits and
// nothing advances by itself, so a learner whose window closes keeps
// their answers and continues by hand. There is no section wide clock.
// Strict full Reading timing is left for a later polish ticket and is
// written up as such.
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// This is the prototype behaviour the four Reading part routes already
// have, and it is deliberately not the forward only rule the full
// Listening run enforces: that rule belongs with strict timing, and both
// are the next Reading ticket. The only navigation out of the exam
// surface is the dashboard button on the score screen.
//
// Marking is requested once, on the move onto the score screen, and the
// result is held so that walking back into a part, changing an answer and
// finishing again re-marks rather than showing a stale score. A request
// id guards against an older reply landing after a newer one, which is
// the pattern all four part prototypes use. A failed request leaves the
// answers untouched and offers a retry, because the answers are the only
// copy there is.
//
// Every screen title, question, option and instruction line comes from
// the section content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock
// Test 1 text of its own. The answer keys are not among them: the route
// strips all four before the content reaches this component, and this
// component never sees a correct option until the learner has finished
// Part 4 and the server sends the review rows back.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// Marks a whole section attempt on the server and returns the per part
// review rows, the section totals and the estimated band. Resolves to
// null when the caller has no session.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the result and not on one particular route's action.
