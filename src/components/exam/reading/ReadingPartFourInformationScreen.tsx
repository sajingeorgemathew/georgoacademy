// The Reading Part 4 split screen (EXAM-22).
//
// Screen type 8 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, in its
// viewpoints variant, and the only working screen this part has:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole part
// - white exam canvas filled edge to edge by one divided work area
// - the website article on the left, own scrollbar
// - the five sentence stems and the reader comment on the right, own
//   scrollbar, on the light blue answer wash
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// It is a sibling of ReadingCorrespondenceScreen,
// ReadingPartTwoInformationScreen and ReadingPartThreeInformationScreen
// rather than a branch inside any of them. The four share everything
// structural, ReadingTwoColumnLayout and the shell and the timer, and
// differ in exactly one thing: what the left column holds. Part 1's is a
// letter, Part 2's is a picture, Part 3's is a set of labelled paragraphs
// whose labels are the answers, and this one's is a website article in
// which several people give their views on one proposal.
//
// The left column here is the closest of the four to Part 1's, running
// prose in paragraphs, and it is still drawn here rather than borrowed
// from that screen. ReadingCorrespondenceScreen draws a letter: it owns
// the salutation and the sign off lines, it owns its own question column,
// and it labels the column "Reading passage". An article has no
// salutation and no sign off, and the column is labelled "Article"
// because the panel on the right is prose too and a learner has to be
// told which of the two "passage" would mean. Reusing that screen would
// mean growing it a set of options for a part it was not written for,
// which is the branch the four sibling screens exist to avoid.
//
// The sections branch is not here at all: nothing in this part is
// answered by naming a paragraph, so the article is
// content.passage.paragraphs and nothing else.
//
// The timer belongs to the part rather than to any question on it.
// Reading is timed per part in every source we hold, which
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 11 records, so the
// window is keyed to the flow screen id and answering a question does not
// restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision, exactly as it is on the
// three Reading screens before it. EXAM-22 passes no onTimeExpire, so the
// reading becomes "Time is up" and the screen stays put with every answer
// still selected. Nothing is submitted, nothing is cleared, and nothing
// advances.
//
// Next is never gated on the answers. A learner may leave any question
// blank and still leave the screen, which is the EXAM-17 rule this part
// inherits rather than rediscovers: a screen that holds Next until every
// question is answered traps a learner who cannot answer one of them.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
