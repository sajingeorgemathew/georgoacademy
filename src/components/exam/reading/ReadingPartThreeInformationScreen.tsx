// The Reading Part 3 split screen (EXAM-20).
//
// Screen type 8 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, in its
// information variant, and the only working screen this part has:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole part
// - white exam canvas filled edge to edge by one divided work area
// - the lettered paragraphs A to E on the left, own scrollbar
// - the nine statements on the right, own scrollbar, on the light blue
//   answer wash
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// It is a sibling of ReadingCorrespondenceScreen and
// ReadingPartTwoInformationScreen rather than a branch inside either. The
// three share everything structural, ReadingTwoColumnLayout and the shell
// and the timer, and differ in exactly one thing: what the left column
// holds. Part 1's is a letter, Part 2's is a picture, and this one's is a
// set of labelled paragraphs whose labels are the answers.
//
// That last point is why the left column is drawn here rather than
// borrowed. In Parts 1 and 2 the passage is read; in Part 3 it is
// scanned, and a learner has to be able to find paragraph C without
// reading B and D to get there. So each section prints its letter as a
// marker in its own narrow column, which keeps the five letters in a
// straight line down the left edge, and the paragraph text keeps one
// comfortable measure beside them. Running "C." into the first sentence
// would be faithful to how the document types it and useless to scan.
//
// Paragraph E is drawn with the other four because the source document
// prints it in the same lettered run and because a learner choosing E has
// to be able to read what it means. It is a choice rather than a
// paragraph, which its own sentence says plainly, so the screen does not
// dress it as anything else.
//
// The prose branch under the sections is there for a part that has both
// labelled sections and unlabelled paragraphs. Mock Test 1 Reading Part 3
// has none of the latter, so it renders nothing.
//
// The timer belongs to the part rather than to any question on it.
// Reading is timed per part in every source we hold, which
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 11 records, so the
// window is keyed to the flow screen id and answering a question does not
// restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision, exactly as it is on the
// Reading Part 1 and Part 2 screens. EXAM-20 passes no onTimeExpire, so
// the reading becomes "Time is up" and the screen stays put with every
// answer still selected. Nothing is submitted, nothing is cleared, and
// nothing advances.
//
// Next is never gated on the answers. A learner may leave any statement
// blank and still leave the screen, which is the EXAM-17 rule this part
// inherits rather than rediscovers: a screen that holds Next until every
// question is answered traps a learner who cannot answer one of them.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
