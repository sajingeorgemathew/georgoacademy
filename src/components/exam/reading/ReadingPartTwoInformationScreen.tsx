// The Reading Part 2 split screen (EXAM-18).
//
// Screen type 8 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, in its
// diagram variant, and the only working screen this part has:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole part
// - white exam canvas filled edge to edge by one divided work area
// - the course brochure on the left, own scrollbar
// - the email and the three questions on the right, own scrollbar, on the
//   light blue answer wash
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// It is a sibling of ReadingCorrespondenceScreen rather than a branch
// inside it. The two share everything structural, ReadingTwoColumnLayout
// and the shell and the timer, and differ in exactly one thing: what the
// left column holds. Reading Part 1's left column is a letter, and this
// one's is a picture with no prose beside it at all, which is a different
// enough thing to render that folding both into one component would mean
// a screen with two mutually exclusive halves and a flag choosing between
// them. ReadingTwoColumnLayout is where the sharing happens, and it
// already anticipated this: its own note says Part 2 is the diagram
// variant and needs nothing from it that Part 1 does not.
//
// The picture is a plain img rather than next/image, for the reason
// ListeningScenarioScreen records: the file is a remote Cloudinary asset,
// so next/image would need an images.remotePatterns entry in
// next.config.ts and would route licensed practice test artwork through
// the Next image optimizer. A plain element keeps both out of scope.
//
// Two things keep the picture behaving inside the exam canvas. Its
// intrinsic width and height go on the element, so the browser reserves
// the right box from the ratio and the question column does not jump when
// the file arrives. And the class recipe sets the width and leaves the
// height automatic, so the brochure fills its column, keeps its shape,
// and scrolls inside the column rather than being squashed to fit or
// pushing the page.
//
// The timer belongs to the part rather than to any question on it.
// Reading is timed per part in every source we hold, which
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 11 records, so the
// window is keyed to the flow screen id and answering a question does not
// restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision, exactly as it is on the
// Reading Part 1 screen. EXAM-18 passes no onTimeExpire, so the reading
// becomes "Time is up" and the screen stays put with every answer still
// selected. Nothing is submitted, nothing is cleared, and nothing
// advances.
//
// Next is never gated on the answers. A learner may leave any question
// blank and still leave the screen, which is the EXAM-17 rule this part
// inherits rather than rediscovers: a screen that holds Next until every
// question is answered traps a learner who cannot answer one of them.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
