// The Reading split screen (EXAM-16).
//
// Screen type 8 from docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, and the
// only working screen a Reading part has:
//
// - grey top bar with a live countdown for the whole part
// - white exam canvas filled edge to edge by one divided work area
// - passage on the left, own scrollbar
// - question panels on the right, own scrollbar, on the light blue answer
//   wash
// - blue Next in the top bar, Back in the bottom bar
//
// The canvas is unpadded and the split draws no outer rule of its own, so
// the canvas border is the only rule around the work area and the divider
// runs the full height between the two columns. That is the same
// arrangement the answer review table uses, and it is why the split reads
// as one screen rather than as a card floating on a white page.
//
// The timer belongs to the part rather than to any question on it.
// Reading is timed per part in every source we hold, which
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 11 records, so the
// window is keyed to the flow screen id and answering a question does not
// restart it.
//
// What happens at zero is the caller's decision, exactly as it is on the
// Listening question screens. EXAM-16 passes no onTimeExpire, so the
// reading becomes "Time is up" and the screen stays put with every answer
// still selected. Nothing is submitted, nothing is cleared, and nothing
// advances. A Reading section flow that has to move a learner on will
// pass a handler.
//
// A client component, because choosing an option is an event handler. It
// holds no state: the answers are owned by the prototype above it, so
// leaving the screen and coming back shows what was chosen before.
//
// Next is never gated on the answers (EXAM-17 fix). A learner may leave
// any question blank and still leave the screen, which is how the real
// test behaves and how the full Listening route already behaves: nothing
// there blocks on an unanswered question either.
//
// The screen used to take allAnswered and requireAllAnswered and hold
// Next disabled until all 11 questions were answered, which trapped a
// learner who could not answer one of them on the last screen of the
// part with no way forward. Both props are gone rather than defaulted
// off, so the gate cannot come back by a caller forgetting to opt out.
//
// The count under the panels still says how many are answered, and the
// hint beside it says plainly that a blank is counted as incorrect, so
// leaving one is an informed choice rather than an accident. Marking
// treats a blank as incorrect, which buildReadingReviewRows and
// summarizeReadingReviewRows do without any help from this screen.
