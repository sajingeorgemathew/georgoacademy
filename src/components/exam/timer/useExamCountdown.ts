// The one clock in the exam engine (EXAM-15D).
//
// Everything before this ticket printed a fixed string in the top bar, and
// the shell was written not to own a clock at all, which was the right
// call while the flows were being built. This hook is where that clock
// finally goes: one place, deadline based, with no opinion about which
// section is asking.
//
// How it stays accurate. The window is an absolute deadline worked out
// once, and every tick asks the current time how much of it is left, so an
// interval delayed by a backgrounded tab or a busy main thread shows a
// smaller number when it next fires rather than making the countdown run
// slow. The arithmetic is in exam-timer-utils.ts and is pure, so the only
// impure thing in the timer at all is the clock, and it is only ever read
// when a window opens, when a tick lands or when a handler runs.
//
// How it resets. A window belongs to config.screenKey, and a change of key
// arrives as a remount rather than as a recalculation inside the hook:
// whatever calls this hook is rendered with key={screenKey}, which is what
// ExamCountdownTimer does and therefore what every screen in the app gets.
//
// That is React's own answer to starting state again when its subject
// changes, and here it is also the only one available. Setting a deadline
// needs the current time, and the two places a hook could read it to do
// the reset itself are both refused by this project's lint rules:
// react-hooks/purity will not allow the clock to be read in a hook body,
// and react-hooks/set-state-in-effect will not allow the new deadline to
// be pushed into state from an effect. A remount runs the initialiser
// below, so a new window opens during the first render of the new screen
// rather than a tick into it.
//
// The reset is therefore tied to the screen and to nothing else. Selecting
// an answer re-renders the screen without remounting it, so the window
// carries on, which is the behaviour the ticket asks for.
//
// What it deliberately does not do. It never navigates, never submits,
// never clears an answer and never renders anything. It reports a reading,
// and the screen decides what that means. In this ticket every Listening
// screen decides the same thing: show it, colour it, and otherwise carry
// on exactly as before.
//
// This is not a proctoring control. The countdown lives in the browser and
// starts again on a reload, which is correct for a practice run and is
// recorded as an intentional gap in
// docs/product/exam-timer-foundation.md.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
