// A live countdown in the exam top bar (EXAM-15D).
//
// The whole timer in one place: it runs the clock, formats the reading,
// picks the tone, and adds the single screen reader announcement. A screen
// hands it a screen key and a duration and is finished with the subject.
//
// It draws exactly what the fixed reading drew before it, in the same slot
// and at the same size, so the top bar does not change shape when a screen
// gains a timer. Three things keep it from moving as it counts:
//
// - the reading is zero padded, so 00:30 and 00:09 are the same width
// - the top bar already sets tabular figures, so the digits do not jiggle
// - only the colour changes at the thresholds, never the size or the
//   spacing
//
// "Time is up" replaces the whole reading, label included. It is shorter
// than the reading it replaces, so the bar can only get roomier at the end
// of a window, never tighter.
//
// What it does not do, because the ticket is explicit about it: no
// submitting, no advancing, no clearing of answers, no dialog, no sound,
// no flashing. Reaching zero changes the words in the bar. Everything else
// on the screen carries on as it was, and the learner's selection is
// untouched.

// changing or by anything else keeps the same key and therefore the same
// mounted window. useExamCountdown explains why the reset is a key rather
// than a recalculation inside the hook.
