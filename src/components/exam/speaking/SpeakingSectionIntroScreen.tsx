// Speaking section intro screen (EXAM-27).
//
// The first screen of the Speaking run. Screen type 1 from
// docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md, so it is the EXAM-02
// ExamInstructionScreen with the section content filled in rather than a
// new layout, exactly as the Reading and Writing section intros are.
//
// The three detail rows are read off the content rather than written into
// the content file: the number of tasks, the sum of the eight preparation
// windows and the sum of the eight recording windows. That is the rule
// the Reading and Writing section intros follow, and it is why the card
// cannot claim a total the section does not have.
//
// The two sums are worth showing separately rather than as one total,
// because they are the two halves of what a Speaking section actually
// asks of a learner: five minutes of planning and nine minutes of
// talking. Together they are 14 minutes, inside the 15 minutes the source
// document publishes for the Speaking Test, with the difference being the
// time spent reading prompts and moving between screens. See
// speaking-mock-timing.ts for where every one of those figures came from.
//
// No timer on this screen. The first preparation window starts when Task
// 1 does.
//
// The notice under the instructions is where the caveats are said, and
// they are said here rather than in a preview label because the exam
// surface carries no label: nothing is saved, nothing is uploaded,
// nothing is scored, and the AI review is the next build.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
