// Mock Test 1 Speaking section (EXAM-27, extended by EXAM-28).
//
// The whole Speaking section as one run: the section intro, eight task
// screens, a short transition before each task after the first, and a
// completion screen. Seventeen screens, built by buildSpeakingSectionFlow
// from the content rather than typed out here.
//
// It owns three pieces of state and nothing else:
//
// - which screen is showing
// - the recordings, as one { taskId: SpeakingResponse } map
// - the review, as one small state machine
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database, to localStorage or to a cookie, and a page reload starts the
// section again with nothing recorded. The one thing that leaves the
// browser is the audio, when the learner presses Submit for AI Review,
// and what comes back is held in the same state as everything else and
// saved nowhere.
//
// EXAM-28 added the review, and it did not add a screen to the flow. The
// completion screen is still the last of the seventeen, and the review
// states are drawn in its place while a review is in flight, has failed,
// or has come back. Adding an eighteenth flow screen would have
// renumbered every screen in the section ("Screen 1 of 18" on the
// intro), for a screen that only some runs ever reach. It is the
// arrangement WritingSectionPrototype already uses.
//
// Why the review is a fetch and not a server action. Its Writing
// counterpart is passed a server action from its page, because a Writing
// submission is two strings. A Speaking submission is up to eight audio
// recordings at once, which is past the body size limit a server action
// carries, so the submission goes to an API route as FormData instead.
// The header note on that route says the rest. The consequence here is
// that this component calls submitSpeakingMockReview rather than being
// handed an action, and that the call cannot be swapped out by the page.
//
// Why a changed recording clears a finished review. The review is a
// judgement of eight particular recordings, so the moment any of them
// changes it is a judgement of audio that no longer exists. Leaving it
// on screen would let a learner re-record Task 3, walk forward, and read
// a level that was estimated from the take they just replaced.
// Re-recording therefore returns the completion screen to its unreviewed
// state, with the Submit for AI Review button live again.
//
// Why recordings survive navigation. They are keyed by task id rather
// than by screen position, and this component stays mounted for the whole
// section, so moving to the transition and back, or to Task 8 and back to
// Task 3, does not touch the map at all. The task screen below is
// remounted by that navigation and the audio is not, which is the whole
// reason the state lives here rather than inside the recorder.
//
// The object URLs, which are the one piece of housekeeping
// -------------------------------------------------------
//
// A recording arrives as a Blob. A Blob cannot be put in an audio element
// directly, so URL.createObjectURL turns it into a blob: URL that
// resolves inside this document. That URL is a handle the browser holds
// open until it is revoked or the document goes away, so this component
// revokes every one it displaces:
//
// - recording again over a take revokes the take it replaced, in the same
//   handler that creates the new one
// - restarting the section revokes every URL in the map before clearing
//   it
//
// The URL is created in an event handler rather than during render or in
// an effect, which is deliberate. Creating one during render would leak a
// handle on every re-render, and this project's lint rules refuse both a
// browser call in a hook body and a state push from an effect. An event
// handler is where both the creation and the revoke belong, and it is
// also the only place that knows which URL is being displaced.
//
// Leaving the page needs no cleanup of its own, because a blob: URL is
// scoped to the document that made it and the browser reclaims all of
// them when that document goes away. What is handled here is the case the
// browser cannot see: a URL displaced while the page stays open.
//
// What this component deliberately does not do:
//
// - it does not transcribe, score or estimate anything itself. It sends
//   the recordings to one endpoint and renders what comes back. No
//   prompt, no model name, no API key and no scoring rule exists in the
//   browser bundle
// - it does not store audio anywhere. The recordings cross to the server
//   once, for the length of one review request, and are never written to
//   Supabase Storage, a database, localStorage or a cookie
// - it does not gate Next on a missing recording. A learner can walk the
//   whole section without recording a word and reach a completion screen
//   that says 0 of 8 tasks recorded, which is the honest reading of what
//   they did
// - it does not act on a timer reaching zero. Neither clock is given an
//   expiry handler, so a closed window shows "Time is up" and nothing
//   else happens: nothing stops, nothing advances and nothing is erased
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// This is the prototype behaviour the Reading and Writing routes already
// have. Strict Speaking timing, with a forward only run, is a later
// ticket.
//
// Every screen title, instruction, prompt and picture comes from the
// content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1 text
// of its own.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// Where the review has got to.
//
// "failed" carries our own message and our own code, never a provider's.
// The server never returns provider text, so there is none to carry. The
// code reaches the error screen for one decision only: whether a retry
// is worth offering.
