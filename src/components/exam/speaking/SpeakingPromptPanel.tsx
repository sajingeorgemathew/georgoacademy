// The task as the source prints it (EXAM-27).
//
// Everything the learner is asked to do, in the order the source prints
// it: the situation paragraph where a task has one, the instruction
// sentence, any further paragraphs under it, the either or pair on the
// one task that has one, and then the pictures.
//
// All of it comes from the content object, so this component carries no
// Mock Test 1 wording of its own. The eight tasks differ a great deal
// from each other, and none of those differences is special cased here:
//
// - Tasks 1 and 2 print one sentence and nothing else
// - Task 3 and Task 4 print a sentence and a picture
// - Task 5 prints a situation, an instruction and two rows of option
//   cards
// - Task 6 prints a situation as its instruction, then "Choose ONE:" and
//   an either or pair
// - Task 7 prints an instruction and its question on a separate line
// - Task 8 prints a sentence and a picture
//
// Every one of those is an empty or filled field on the same content
// type, so an absent field renders nothing rather than a branch.
//
// The either or pair is not a control. The source asks the learner to
// pick one in their head and speak, so nothing here is selectable,
// nothing is stored, and nothing is gated on it. That is why it is not
// modelled as the Writing radio group: a radio group would promise a
// choice this task does not record.
//
// promptNote is the one line on this panel that is ours rather than the
// source's, and only Task 5 has one. It says where this screen departs
// from the source screens, which is better than silently rearranging the
// source and better than printing source wording that describes a step
// this prototype does not build.
//
// Presentational only. It holds no state.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
