// The working screen for one Speaking task (EXAM-27).
//
// The prompt and its pictures on the left, and on the right the two
// clocks, the recorder and the playback of whatever was recorded. All
// eight Mock Test 1 tasks use this one screen, which is why there is no
// SpeakingTaskThreeScreen and no SpeakingTaskFiveScreen: the eight differ
// only in what their content object holds, and every one of those
// differences is already expressed there as an empty list or an unset
// field.
//
// The split is the shared ExamTwoColumnLayout, with the same division of
// scrolling the Writing task screen chose and for a related reason. The
// prompt column scrolls on its own, because Task 5 is a long situation
// and four option cards and would otherwise push the recorder off the
// screen. The answer column does not, because the Stop recording button
// must never be somewhere a learner has to scroll to find while a clock
// is running.
//
// What this screen owns, and why it is not more
// ---------------------------------------------
//
// Three pieces of state, all of them about the take in progress rather
// than about the recording that results:
//
// - status, which is what the recorder is doing right now
// - errorKind, which is why the last attempt failed, if it did
// - takeKey, which opens the recording window and is null when nothing is
//   recording
//
// All three are deliberately local, and all three are deliberately lost
// when the learner leaves the screen. A take in progress is not something
// to resume from another task: leaving unmounts the recorder, which stops
// the MediaRecorder and releases the microphone, so the honest thing for
// the screen to remember about it is nothing.
//
// The finished recording is the opposite, and lives one level up in
// SpeakingSectionPrototype. That is what makes it survive navigation: the
// prototype stays mounted for the whole section, so walking to the next
// task and back rebuilds this screen and leaves the audio exactly where
// it was.
//
// The preparation window ends when recording starts, whether or not it
// had run out, because at that point the learner is speaking rather than
// preparing. The recording window opens on the same event and closes when
// the take does. Neither clock does anything at zero except change its
// own reading.
//
// Next is never gated on a recording. A learner may leave a task with
// nothing recorded and still move on, which is the same rule every
// Reading and Writing screen in the engine follows: a screen that holds
// Next until an answer exists traps a learner whose microphone does not
// work.
//
// A client component, because pressing Start recording is an event
// handler and because the two clocks tick.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
