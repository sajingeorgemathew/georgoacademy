// Mock Test 1 Writing section (EXAM-25, extended by EXAM-26).
//
// The whole Writing section as one run: the section intro, Task 1, a
// short transition, Task 2, and a completion screen. Five screens, built
// by buildWritingSectionFlow from the content rather than typed out here.
//
// It owns three pieces of state and nothing else:
//
// - the responses, as one { taskId: text } map
// - the chosen positions, as one { taskId: optionId } map
// - the review, as one small state machine
//
// All three live in local component state. Nothing is written to a
// database, to localStorage or to a cookie, no Supabase client is
// imported here, and a page reload starts the section again. The one
// thing that leaves the browser is the pair of responses, when the
// learner presses Submit for AI Review, and what comes back is held in
// the same state as everything else and saved nowhere.
//
// EXAM-26 added the review, and it did not add a screen to the flow. The
// completion screen is still the last of the five, and the review states
// are drawn in its place while a review is in flight, has failed, or has
// come back. Adding a sixth flow screen would have renumbered every
// screen in the section ("Screen 1 of 6" on the intro), for a screen that
// only some runs ever reach.
//
// Why responses survive navigation. They are keyed by task id rather than
// by screen position, and this component stays mounted for the whole
// section, so moving to the transition and back, or to Task 2 and back to
// Task 1, does not touch the map at all. The task screen below is
// remounted by that navigation and the text is not, which is the whole
// reason the state lives here rather than inside the editor.
//
// Why the two maps are separate. A choice and an essay are different
// answers to different questions, and only Task 2 has both. Keeping them
// apart means changing a position cannot disturb a response, which
// matters: a learner who clicks the other option halfway through Task 2
// keeps every word they have written.
//
// Why a changed response clears a finished review. The review is a
// judgement of two particular pieces of text, so the moment either of
// them changes it is a judgement of writing that no longer exists.
// Leaving it on screen would let a learner edit Task 2, walk forward, and
// read a level that was estimated from the paragraph they just deleted.
// Editing therefore returns the completion screen to its unreviewed
// state, with the Submit for AI Review button live again.
//
// What this component deliberately does not do:
//
// - it does not mark anything against an answer key. Writing has none,
//   which is why the server action beside this flow reviews rather than
//   marks
// - it does not construct an OpenAI client, read an environment variable
//   or hold a prompt. It calls one server action and renders what comes
//   back
// - it does not gate Next on an empty response or an unmade choice. A
//   learner can walk the whole section without typing a word and reach a
//   completion screen that says 0 words, twice, which is the honest
//   reading of what they did
// - it does not act on a timer reaching zero. No onTimeExpire is passed
//   to either task screen, so a closed window shows "Time is up" and
//   nothing else happens: nothing submits, nothing advances, and nothing
//   is erased
//
// Back is enabled throughout, which the official-style flow would not
// allow, so the sequence can be walked through repeatedly during review.
// This is the prototype behaviour the Reading routes already have.
// Strict Writing timing, with a forward only run, is a later ticket.
//
// Every screen title, instruction, prompt and option comes from the
// content object passed in, so this component carries no Mock Test 1 text
// of its own.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// Sends both responses for AI review and returns the practice estimate.
//
// Passed in rather than imported, so this component depends on the shape
// of the outcome and not on one particular route's action. It is the same
// arrangement ReadingSectionPrototype uses for its marking action, and
// for the same reason: the component stays renderable without a server.
