// The writing area for one task (EXAM-25).
//
// A plain textarea, a label above it and the live word count under it.
// Nothing else: no toolbar, no formatting controls, no autosave
// indicator, no submit button. A CELPIP writing space is a plain text
// field with a word count and a spell check, which
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 12 records, and this
// is that.
//
// It is a controlled field and it owns no state. The text lives in the
// prototype above it, keyed by task id, which is what lets a response
// survive moving to the next task and back again: this component is
// remounted by that navigation and the text is not.
//
// Line breaks are kept exactly as typed, because a Task 1 email has a
// greeting, paragraphs and a sign off, and a field that collapsed them
// would make the format of the response impossible to judge later.
//
// spellCheck is on. It is a browser feature rather than anything we
// built, and the official writing space has one, so switching it off
// would make our editor harder to use than the thing it stands in for.
//
// What it deliberately does not do: it does not save, it does not
// validate, it does not block an empty response, and it does not submit
// anything to an AI reviewer. Typing here has exactly one effect, which
// is that the text and the count change.
//
// Presentational, so no "use client" of its own: it is rendered by the
// prototype, which is the client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
