// Mock test entry point on the learner dashboard (EXAM-15A, Reading
// internal preview cards added by EXAM-18, cut back to one by EXAM-24).
//
// This replaces ExamShellPreviewLink, which grew one dashed "Internal
// preview" card per ticket until nine of them sat on the dashboard: the
// shell preview, the instruction preview, the six Listening part
// prototypes, and the full Listening section. Eight of the nine were
// internal build steps that a learner had no reason to see, and the one
// that mattered was last in the list and dressed the same as the rest.
//
// The Reading cards went the same way. EXAM-18, EXAM-20 and EXAM-22 each
// added a part card, because every Reading route runs in exam mode, an
// exam mode route carries no dashboard chrome and no preview label, and
// so the only way to open one was to paste its URL. By the time the
// fourth arrived there were five Reading cards beside the Listening one,
// and four of the five were internal build steps rather than the thing a
// learner opens.
//
// So the dashboard shows one card per built section, for the routes that
// run a whole section:
//
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/reading
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/writing
//
// EXAM-25 added the third. It follows the same rule as the other two: one
// card per section a learner can sit end to end, and no card for a screen
// inside one. There are no individual Writing task cards for the same
// reason there are no Reading part cards.
//
// These routes lost their card and kept working. They are the way to
// check a single part during development, and they open normally when
// the URL is typed:
//
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/shell-preview
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/instruction-preview
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-1
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-2
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-3
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-4
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-5
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/listening/part-6
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/reading/part-1
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/reading/part-2
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/reading/part-3
//   /dashboard/mock-tests/mock-test-1/reading/part-4
//
// Nothing was deleted to hide them. They are simply not linked from
// anywhere, and they all carry robots noindex already. The four Reading
// part routes are still listed in exam-mode-routes.ts, so a typed URL
// still opens the locked exam surface it always did.
//
// The Listening card is deliberately styled as a real practice module
// card rather than an internal note: solid panel, a plain Available pill,
// and no Internal preview badge. The wording is the student facing entry
// point wording the product will keep. The prototype caveats did not go
// away, they moved to where they belong, which is the standing notice on
// the route itself: nothing is saved, media can be replayed, the timer is
// static, and the practice score is not an official CELPIP score.
//
// The Reading card beside it is still dressed as an internal build link,
// following the rule ExamShellPreviewLink set: a tinted panel with a
// dashed rule rather than the solid one, an Internal preview badge where
// the Available pill sits, and a secondary button rather than the navy
// call to action. The layout underneath is the Listening layout, so the
// two read as one section rather than as two designs. It stays a preview
// card because the Reading run keeps the prototype behaviour its ticket
// left in place, no strict section timing and a Back button that works
// throughout, and a card dressed as a released module would be claiming
// otherwise.
//
// What neither card says, because none of it is true yet: that a full
// all-skills Mock Test 1 exists, or that any of this produces an official
// CELPIP result. Two sections of four are built.
