// Mock Test 1, Listening Part 4: Listening to a News Item (EXAM-09).
//
// Source: mock-tests/mock-test-1/Mock Test 1 -Sajinlinks.docx, Listening
// PART 04, with the Cloudinary URL cross checked against
// mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-links.md. Nothing was downloaded and
// nothing is re-hosted. The clip is served straight from Cloudinary.
//
// This is licensed Toronto Academy content. Every route that imports this
// file must sit behind the dashboard auth guard.
//
// Part 4 is the first part that does not fit ListeningPartContent. Parts
// 1 to 3 interleave conversation clips with one question screen each and
// never print a question. Part 4 plays one news item and then prints all
// five questions on one screen as incomplete statements with dropdowns.
// It is typed as ListeningDropdownPartContent instead. The reasoning is
// in the header of src/features/exam-engine/listening-dropdown-types.ts.
//
// Three notes on the source material, all deliberate:
//
// - The first statement wraps "magician's" in a curly apostrophe. It is
//   normalized to a straight apostrophe here, the same normalization
//   EXAM-03, EXAM-05 and EXAM-07 applied in Parts 1 to 3. Typography
//   only. No wording changed.
// - The source document says the news item is heard once. That sentence
//   is kept in the intro bullets because the ticket asks for it, and it
//   is not yet true of this prototype: the clip can be replayed and Next
//   does not wait for it to finish. One time playback arrives with a
//   later ticket. Recorded as a fidelity gap in
//   docs/product/listening-part-4-prototype.md section 10.
// - Part 4 has no question audio at all. The questions are read on
//   screen, which is why ListeningDropdownQuestion has no audio field.
//
// The answer key is confirmed and complete, which means this file must
// never be handed to the browser whole. See the note on ANSWER_KEY.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// Answer key for the whole part, one entry per question, in order.
//
// source is "answer-image" on every entry because each value was read off
// the Part 4 answer screenshot rather than out of the source document
// text. The option text is repeated in a trailing comment so the id can
// be checked against the question below without scrolling, and so a later
// edit to an option cannot quietly move an answer.
//
// Every value below was matched to an existing option by exact text,
// punctuation included. No option wording was changed to make a key fit,
// and nothing was guessed.
//
// The key is complete, so shipping it to the browser would hand a learner
// the answers. The Part 4 route strips it with
// withoutListeningDropdownAnswerKey before rendering, the same way the
// Part 2 and Part 3 routes strip theirs. Nothing here is rendered on the
// question screen.
//
// EXAM-09 builds no review and no score, so nothing reads this yet. The
// next ticket marks the answers on the server, where the key stays.
