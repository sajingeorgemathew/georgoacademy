// Mock Test 1, Reading Part 1: Reading Correspondence (EXAM-16).
//
// Source: mock-tests/mock-test-1/Mock Test 1 -Sajinlinks.docx, the block
// headed "Part 1: Reading Correspondence", cross checked against the part
// summary in docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md and the outline in
// mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-content-outline.md.
//
// This is licensed Toronto Academy content. Every route that imports this
// file must sit behind the dashboard auth guard.
//
// The part has no assets of any kind. The content map records it as "all
// text", and extracted-links.md lists no Cloudinary URL for it, so there
// is nothing here to reference and nothing to download.
//
// Notes on the source material, all deliberate:
//
// - The document's curly apostrophes and curly quotation marks are
//   written as straight ones, which is the house style and what the
//   Listening content files already do.
// - Paragraph 2 of the message contains one em dash, in "I'm not a nature
//   guy - a fact which might explain". The house style forbids em dashes,
//   so it is written as a spaced normal hyphen. That is the only
//   character in the passage that is not the document's own.
// - Question 1 option c reads "no longer live in Vancouver" with no full
//   stop, where the other three options in the group end with one. That
//   is the document's own inconsistency and it is kept, because option
//   text is source text and correcting punctuation silently is how a
//   transcription starts to drift.
// - The reply prints "you are right, 10. _______ ." with a space before
//   the full stop. The space is a consequence of the underscores being
//   typed inline and is dropped here, so the sentence closes normally
//   once the blank is filled.
// - The two author notes in this block, "(the passage will come here on
//   the left side of the screen)" and "And question will appear on the
//   right side of the screen", are instructions to us and not learner
//   facing copy. They are not in this file. What they describe is the
//   layout the split screen already implements.
//
// The stem text below stops where the document's underscores begin. The
// blank is drawn by the question list, so the underscores are not stored.
// The same is true inside the reply, where a blank is a segment rather
// than a run of underscores in a string.
//
// The answer key is confirmed and complete, which means this file must
// never be handed to the browser whole. See the note on ANSWER_KEY.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

import type {
  ReadingAnswerKeyEntry,
  ReadingPartContent,
} from "@/features/exam-engine/reading-types";

// Answer key for the whole part, one entry per question, in order.
//
// source is "document" on every entry because Reading answer keys are
// printed as text in the source document, in four tables under
// "Answers & Explanations". Reading needed no transcription from
// screenshots, which is the difference between this key and the six
// Listening keys.
//
// Every value below was matched to an existing option by exact text.
// Where the key table prints a trailing full stop and the option does
// not, or the reverse, the match was made on the wording; no option text
// was changed to make a key fit, and nothing was guessed. The option text
// is repeated in a trailing comment so the id can be checked against the
// question below without scrolling, and so a later edit to an option
// cannot quietly move an answer.
//
// The key is complete, so shipping it to the browser would hand a learner
// the answers. The Reading Part 1 route strips it with
// withoutReadingAnswerKey before rendering, the same way every Listening
// route strips its own, so nothing here reaches the question screen.
// EXAM-16 marks nothing, so the key is read by nobody yet. EXAM-17 must
// read it on the server, beside this file, and send back finished review
// rows rather than the key itself.

      "Has everyone adjusted to their new city yet? I know moving to Vancouver might have been difficult on your family, but you made the right choice. You would have been crazy to pass up such an amazing opportunity. That being said, the office sure isn't the same without you!",
      "Anyways, you'd been asking if I had plans for the \"big anniversary,\" so I had to write and tell what happened. Since Kelly loves the outdoors, I had the brilliant idea of hiking in Algonquin Park. I say \"brilliant\" because, as you know, I'm not a nature guy - a fact which might explain why my romantic gesture went so wrong.",
      "We decided to bring Sparky, figuring he'd love running around off-leash. Big mistake! We'd been hiking for about 2 hours when Sparky, having spotted something interesting, suddenly tore off into the bush. Worried he'd get lost, we went chasing after him. Apparently, however, we should've been more worried about ourselves getting lost. By the time we'd caught up with him, the trail was nowhere in sight and we had no idea where we were. While Sparky sat wagging his tail, thinking this was the best game ever, Kelly and I panicked. Since we hadn't told anyone where we were going, it made no sense to stay put and wait for help. So we decided to keep walking, hoping we'd picked the right direction. Five hours later, with no sight of the trail and a darkening sky, we had our doubts. Amazingly, just as we started to think all was lost, we stumbled across an abandoned ranger cabin. There wasn't much inside, but it had the essentials: a map, a compass, a few cans of beans, and a bed. Having eaten the last of our food hours ago, we quickly dug into the beans. Then, exhausted, we collapsed into bed. The next morning we used the map and compass to lead us out of the woods. It turns out we'd only been a few kilometres from our car!",
      "Needless to say, I have no intention of venturing back into the woods any time soon. Make sure to be careful if you do any hiking out there. It's easier to get lost than you think!",
