// Mock Test 1, Speaking section content (EXAM-27).
//
// All eight Speaking tasks and the section instruction screen, as one
// content object. Everything a learner reads on the nine content screens
// is here, and nothing is anywhere else.
//
// Where the content came from
// ---------------------------
//
// The section instructions and the eight task names are text in
// `mock-tests/mock-test-1/Mock Test 1 -Sajinlinks.docx`:
//
//   Speaking Test Instructions
//   ... five instruction sentences ...
//   Try to complete this practice Speaking Test in 15 minutes.
//   Speaking Task 1: Giving Advice
//   Speaking Task 2: Talking about a Personal Experience
//   Speaking Task 3: Describing a Scene
//   Speaking Task 4: Making Predictions
//   Speaking Task 5: Comparing and Persuading
//   Speaking Task 6: Dealing with a Difficult Situation
//   Speaking Task 7: Expressing Opinions
//   Speaking Task 8: Describing an Unusual Situation
//
// The eight prompts themselves are not text in that document. Each task
// carries a Cloudinary PNG and nothing else, nine images in all because
// Task 5 has two, which is what
// `mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-content-outline.md` records as
// "all prompt images only" and what
// `docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md` lists as an open content gap:
// "Type out the eight Speaking prompts as text."
//
// This ticket closes that gap for Speaking. Every prompt sentence, every
// option card heading and every card detail line below is transcribed
// word for word from those nine images, which are the same nine URLs
// listed under "Speaking images" in
// `mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-links.md`. Nothing is paraphrased,
// nothing is reworded into house style, and nothing is added. The one
// change made to the characters themselves is the house style rule: the
// source images use curly apostrophes and this file uses straight ones.
//
// The nine source images, for anyone checking a transcription:

//   Task 3  v1785339602/Speaking_Test_1_-_Task_3_ciuvf2_xuy0my.png
//   Task 4  v1785339642/Speaking_Test_1_-_Task_4_im56t0_bepfcq.png
//   Task 5  v1785339673/Speaking_Test_1_-_Task_5_1_c0vbub_giqbsl.png

//   Task 8  v1785339814/Speaking_Test_1_-_Task_8_hldd7b_dd0ael.png
//
// Why the visual prompts are cropped
// ----------------------------------
//
// Four tasks show pictures, and on three of them the picture is the
// prompt: Task 3 asks the learner to describe a scene, Task 4 asks what
// happens next in it, and Task 8 asks them to describe an unusual one. A
// transcription cannot replace those. So unlike the Writing prompt
// images, which are shown whole beside a full text transcription, these
// are shown as content.
//
// Each source image is a screenshot of a whole official screen, not a
// bare picture. It carries the prompt sentence across the top, the
// picture below it, and on Tasks 3, 4 and 8 a grey "Preparation Time"
// panel beside the picture holding a frozen number. Showing that whole
// screenshot would put the prompt on the page twice and would put a dead
// clock reading 29 next to our live preparation countdown, which is a
// misleading thing to show a learner.
//
// So the picture is cut out of the screenshot with a Cloudinary c_crop
// transformation, and the prompt sentence is transcribed as text above
// it. The crop is a delivery parameter on the same referenced asset: no
// file is downloaded, nothing is re-hosted, and the untransformed URL
// still returns the original screenshot for anyone checking the crop. The
// same rule extracted-links.md sets for every Mock Test 1 asset still
// holds.
//
// The Task 5 photographs are cropped out of their two screenshots for the
// same reason: the option card text is transcribed beside each photograph
// rather than left as pixels.
//
// What is deliberately not here
// -----------------------------
//
// No answer key, because Speaking has none. No transcript, no score, no
// band and no feedback text. No Writing content. No Speaking instructions
// video screen: a Speaking clip is registered in
// instructional-video-assets.ts and the source document does note that a
// Speaking instructions video appears after the instructions, but adding
// a video screen is a change to the screen flow the ticket sets out and
// is left as a follow up.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
