// Mock Test 1, Reading Part 3: Reading for Information (EXAM-20).
//
// Source: mock-tests/mock-test-1/Mock Test 1 -Sajinlinks.docx, the block
// headed "Reading Part 3: Reading for Information", cross checked against
// the part summary in docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md, the
// outline in mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-content-outline.md and the
// part rules in docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 10.
//
// This is licensed Toronto Academy content. Every route that imports this
// file must sit behind the dashboard auth guard.
//
// The part has no assets. mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-links.md lists
// one Reading image in the whole test and it belongs to Part 2, so
// everything below is text taken from the document.
//
// What makes this part different from the two before it. Parts 1 and 2
// ask questions whose options are written for each question. Part 3 asks
// nine statements and answers every one of them by naming a lettered
// paragraph, A to E, which is the same five choices nine times over.
// docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md section 10 calls it the one
// Reading part whose options are shared across all questions, and
// docs/product/admin-mock-test-builder-blueprint.md section 3.5 gives the
// future database an option_set_id for exactly this reason: it does not
// want 45 near duplicate option rows that have to be kept in sync.
//
// This file honours that without changing the shared ReadingQuestion
// shape. The five choices are written once, in PARAGRAPH_LABELS, and
// buildParagraphOptions stamps them onto each statement with ids of its
// own. So there is one place the option list is edited, the answer key
// still points at a real option on a real question, and
// ReadingQuestionList, ReadingQuestionPanel and the EXAM-21 marking that
// follows all read the part exactly as they read Parts 1 and 2. Nothing
// shared had to learn about option sets for one part.
//
// Notes on the source material, all deliberate:
//
// - The document's curly quotes and apostrophes are written as straight
//   ones, and the one long dash in paragraph A, in "Robert Ralph
//   Carmichael - a loon on one side", is written as a normal hyphen. The
//   en dash in "$175-250 million" in paragraph B is written as a normal
//   hyphen too. This is the house style every content file in the
//   repository already follows and no wording is changed by it.
// - The instruction line above the paragraphs reads "Read the following
//   message." in the document. The passage is a magazine style article
//   about the Canadian one dollar coin rather than a message, so the line
//   looks like a copy and paste from Reading Part 1. It is carried
//   verbatim anyway, because this codebase does not rewrite source
//   wording, and the mismatch is written up as a source gap in
//   docs/product/reading-part-3-prototype.md.
// - Paragraph E is not a paragraph. "E. Not given in any of the above
//   paragraphs." is the fixed fifth choice, printed by the document in
//   the same lettered run as A to D. It is kept there, on the passage
//   side, because that is where the document puts it and because a
//   learner has to be able to read what choosing E means. The research
//   document and the content map both describe it the same way.
// - The nine statements print no numbers in the document. They run one
//   after another under the heading "Questions:", each with its own
//   A to E list. The numbering below is document order, 1 to 9, which is
//   what the answer key table confirms: it runs Question 1 to Question 9
//   and gives C D B E A E E A D against the statements in that order.
// - The two author notes in this block, "(the passage will come here on
//   the left side of the screen)" and "And question will appear on the
//   right side of the screen", are instructions to us and not learner
//   facing copy. They are not in this file. What they describe is the
//   layout the split screen already implements.
//
// The nine statements are whole sentences with no blank anywhere in them,
// so each one carries text and none carries textBefore. That is the
// question shape EXAM-18 added for Reading Part 2 questions 6 to 8, and
// it fits these without any change.
//
// The answer key is confirmed and complete, which means this file must
// never be handed to the browser whole. See the note on ANSWER_KEY.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

          'On May 8, 1987, Canada introduced the one-dollar coin now known as the "loonie." It is eleven-sided and gold-coloured (it\'s actually bronze-plated nickel). The coin features a design by Ontario wildlife artist Robert Ralph Carmichael - a loon on one side and Queen Elizabeth II on the other. Canada is, after all, still a member of the British Commonwealth. The loon is a water bird common across Canada, known for its ability to swim great distances under water and for its beautiful, haunting call.',

A silver dollar was introduced in 1935, featuring an image of two voyageurs paddling a canoe on one side and, to display Canada's British connections, an image of Britain's King George on the other. But the silver dollar-which was made of nickel by 1967-wasn't used much because of its size and weight (about 23 grams). What was in common use was a green-and-white paper bill. However, the paper bills wore out within a year, which is why the loonie was introduced. It was expected to last twenty years, saving taxpayers $175-250 million.",

The dies were entrusted to a courier service instead of to a high-security service. Worse, apparently no one asked the courier representative who showed up to take possession of the dies for identification. Worse still, designs for both sides of the coin went in the same package instead of in separate packages. For these reasons, the Mint suspected foul play and, fearing counterfeits, decided to go with a new design, that by Carmichael. An investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police concluded, however, that the dies were simply lost in transit.",

Already light, at 7.3 grams, a lighter version was introduced in 2012 by replacing the nickel with steel. A lighter version of the loonie was also introduced. Unfortunately, the lighter coins didn\'t work in coin-operated machines, such as vending machines, parking meters, and washers and dryers in laundromats.
