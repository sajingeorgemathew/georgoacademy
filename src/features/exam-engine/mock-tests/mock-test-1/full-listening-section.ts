// Mock Test 1, full Listening section (EXAM-15).
//
// The six Listening parts assembled into one section, plus the two screens
// that open it. This file writes no question, no option, no clip URL and
// no answer key of its own: every part below is the same exported content
// object its part level prototype route already renders, so the full run
// and the part runs cannot drift apart.
//
// What this file adds is the small amount the section needs and a part
// does not carry: which part number a part is, how a learner names it, and
// the Format line for its intro card. Those three were previously typed
// into the six prototype components, which is why they are collected here
// rather than added to the content files.
//
// The instructional video is looked up from the EXAM-02 registry rather
// than referenced by path, so the Listening clip this section plays is the
// same file the instruction preview plays.
//
// The answer keys stay in the six content files and are stripped by
// withoutListeningSectionAnswerKeys before the content reaches the
// browser. Marking happens in the server action beside the route, where
// the keys still are. See listening-section-flow.ts.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
