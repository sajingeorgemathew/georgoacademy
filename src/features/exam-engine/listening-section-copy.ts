// Learner facing wording for the full Listening section screens
// (EXAM-15).
//
// Same rule as listening-copy.ts and listening-review-copy.ts: the screens
// the section owns share one wording file, so a change lands in one place
// rather than in seven components.
//
// Three wording rules this file exists to hold the line on:
//
// - Nothing here claims an official CELPIP score or an official CELPIP
//   level. The result is named a Toronto Academy practice result every
//   time it appears, and the note under it says so in a full sentence.
// - Nothing on a part transition screen says anything about how the
//   learner did. A transition is a doorway between two parts, and a score
//   there would be the part level score this ticket exists to remove.
// - Nothing here says an answer is wrong when the answer key is missing.
//   The pending wording is about the key, never about the learner.
//
// buildListeningSectionCopy takes the test label, the way
// buildListeningReviewCopy takes the part label, so a second mock test
// gets its wording from a call rather than from a copy of this file.
//
// Strings and pure helpers only, no side effects, so this file is safe to
// import from a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

    //   CELPIP score. Nothing here says official score, official band,
    //   guaranteed band or final result.
    // - The range note says out loud that the source chart's rows overlap,
    //   so a two level reading reads as the chart being approximate rather
    //   than as the app being unsure of its own arithmetic.
    // - The source note says where the mapping came from, so a learner or a
    //   teacher can check it, and does not claim the mapping models how a
    //   real level is calculated. It does not.
