// Answer review rows for a Reading part (EXAM-17).
//
// The Reading counterpart of the row building half of listening-score.ts.
// Pure functions over the part content and the answer map: no React, no
// side effects, no storage, no network, so the same helpers run on the
// server beside the answer key, which is the only place they are meant to
// run.
//
// This file is the one place a Reading answer is compared to a Reading
// key. reading-score.ts counts the rows this file produces rather than
// marking a second time, so the score and the review cannot disagree
// about a single question. That is the whole reason the two files are
// split this way round.
//
// It is deliberately not merged into listening-score.ts. The Listening
// core carries a fourth outcome, "answer key pending", because Listening
// was built while its keys were still being read off answer images, and
// its summary can withhold a score for the same reason. Reading Part 1
// ships with a complete key printed in the source document, so widening
// the Listening core to take a fifth content shape would mean importing
// a nullable score into a section that does not have one.
//
// Key resolution order per question, the same order Listening uses:
//
//   1. content.answerKey entry for the question, when its correctOptionId
//      is set
//   2. question.correctOptionId, for a part whose key is written question
//      by question
//   3. nothing, which leaves correctOptionId null on the row
//
// A key that names an option the question does not have is discarded and
// counts as missing, because a stale id in the key is a content bug and
// marking every learner wrong over it would be the worst answer
// available. A question with no usable key is never counted correct, and
// Mock Test 1 Reading Part 1 has none: its key is complete and confirmed,
// and reading-part-1.ts records where every entry came from.
//
// Nothing here writes an explanation. The source document publishes none
// for Reading, so the field is null throughout, and no AI and no guess
// fills it in.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// The question as the review prints it.
//
// Two shapes, the same two the question list draws:
//
// - A stem question, 1 to 6 in Reading Part 1, prints its sentence with
//   three dots where the blank falls. Dots rather than the row of
//   underscores the question screen draws: on the question screen the
//   underscores mark where the control goes, and in the review the answer
//   is already printed beside the stem, so the same underscores would be
//   noise. This is the rule formatListeningStatementLabel settled for the
//   Listening dropdown parts.
// - A blank inside the reply, 7 to 11, prints no stem of its own. The
//   sentence it completes is in the letter, and repeating anything here
//   would be inventing a stem the source does not have, so the row says
//   which blank it is instead.
// - A whole question, added by EXAM-18 for Reading Part 2 questions 6 to
//   8, prints as it stands. There is no blank in it, so there is nothing
//   to mark with dots.
//
// The whole question case is handled here rather than left to the ticket
// that builds the Part 2 review, because without it a whole question
// would fall through to the reply blank branch below and print "Blank in
// the written response." against a question that is not a blank and has
// no reply. Nothing calls this with a Part 2 question yet: EXAM-18 builds
// no Reading Part 2 review and no Reading Part 2 score. This is the
// shared helper being made correct for a shape that now exists, not the
// review being started.
