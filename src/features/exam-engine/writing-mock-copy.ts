// Learner facing wording for the Mock Test 1 Writing section (EXAM-25,
// extended by EXAM-26).
//
// Same rule as exam-copy.ts, listening-copy.ts and reading-copy.ts: all
// Writing mock test chrome copy lives in one file so the screens say the
// same thing everywhere, and so a wording change is one edit rather than
// eight.
//
// Two wording rules this file exists to hold the line on:
//
// - Nothing here promises an official result. EXAM-26 added an AI review
//   and an estimated Writing level, so the screens no longer say a review
//   is coming later, but every one of them names what it is: a Toronto
//   Academy practice estimate, AI-supported, and not an official CELPIP
//   score. The words "official CELPIP score", "official result",
//   "guaranteed score" and "pass guarantee" appear nowhere in this file
//   except in the sentences that deny them.
// - Nothing here names the official test as the thing the learner is
//   sitting. This is CELPIP Decoded practice software, which is the rule
//   docs/product/exam-engine-reference-audit.md section 9 sets out.
//
// What is deliberately not copied from the source document: the Writing
// instruction sentence that begins "On the official test, if you do not
// finish Task 1 in 27 minutes, the screen will move to Task 2." Half of
// it describes the official test rather than this one, and the half that
// is true here, that you move forward by pressing Next, is said plainly
// in the section instructions instead. The 27 minute figure it carries is
// used, as the Task 1 window: see writing-section.ts.
//
// Strings and pure helpers only, no side effects, so this file is safe to
// import from a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
