// Learner facing wording for the Listening review, score and end screens
// (EXAM-04, made part agnostic by EXAM-06).
//
// Same rule as listening-copy.ts: the closing screens share one wording
// file, so a change lands in one place rather than in five components.
//
// Two wording rules this file exists to hold the line on:
//
// - Nothing here claims an official CELPIP score or an official CELPIP
//   level. The result is named a Toronto Academy practice result every
//   time it appears, and the note under it says so in a full sentence.
// - Nothing here says an answer is wrong when the answer key is missing.
//   The pending wording is about the key, never about the learner.
//
// EXAM-04 wrote "Listening Part 1" into eight of these strings, which is
// what docs/product/listening-part-1-review-score.md section 9 flagged as
// the one thing standing between the closing screens and a second part.
// buildListeningReviewCopy takes the part label instead, and the Part 1
// export below is that builder called with the Part 1 labels, so every
// Part 1 string is character for character what it was.
//
// Strings and pure helpers only, no side effects, so this file is safe to
// import from a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
