// Screen order and answer helpers for a Listening part (EXAM-03).
//
// Pure functions over ListeningPartContent, no React and no side effects,
// so the flow can be built on the server, rendered on the client, and
// tested on its own later.
//
// The order is derived from the content rather than typed out, so adding
// a fourth conversation section or a ninth question changes the data and
// nothing else. For Mock Test 1 Listening Part 1 it produces 18 screens:
//
//   1  part intro
//   2  scenario
//   3  conversation section 1
//   4  question 1
//   5  question 2
//   6  section break before section 2
//   7  conversation section 2
//   8  question 3
//   9  question 4
//  10  question 5
//  11  section break before section 3
//  12  conversation section 3
//  13  question 6
//  14  question 7
//  15  question 8
//  16  answer review
//  17  practice score
//  18  end of part
//
// Screens 16 to 18 were added by EXAM-04. They took the place of the
// EXAM-03 completion placeholder, which announced an answer review that
// did not exist yet.
//
// EXAM-05 added the ending option. Listening Part 2 has no review and no
// score yet, so it closes on a single completion screen instead, and its
// nine screen flow is:
//
//   1  part intro
//   2  scenario
//   3  conversation
//   4  question 1
//   ...
//   8  question 5
//   9  part complete
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
