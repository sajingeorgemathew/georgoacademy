// Types for a video discussion Listening part (EXAM-11).
//
// Screen type 5 followed by screen type 7 in
// docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md: one video, then every
// question for the part on a single screen. Listening Part 5 is the only
// part built this way, and it is the only Listening part with a video at
// all.
//
// This is a third content shape, beside ListeningPartContent in
// listening-types.ts and ListeningDropdownPartContent in
// listening-dropdown-types.ts. It is close to the dropdown shape and
// deliberately not merged with it:
//
// - A dropdown part's media is a clip. This part's media is a video, so
//   the screen that plays it is a different component with a poster, an
//   aspect ratio and a picture to lay out.
// - A dropdown question is an incomplete statement split around a blank,
//   answered from a select. A question here is a whole question answered
//   from a radio group, so it has one prompt string and no blank, and
//   textBefore and textAfter would be dead fields on every question.
//
// docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md records the source document as
// carrying both instruction lines for this part, "Choose the best way to
// answer each question" and the drop-down menu sentence, and settles it:
// the questions are full questions rather than sentence stems, so the
// drop-down sentence is a copy and paste artefact and the question
// wording is the one to use. This shape follows that reading.
//
// What the three shapes share is imported rather than copied: the
// scenario shape, the instruction bullet shape, and the answer key entry.
//
// This file holds types only, no runtime values, so it can be imported
// from a server component or a client component without pulling any
// behaviour along with it. The helpers live in listening-video-flow.ts.
// Same rule listening-types.ts and listening-dropdown-types.ts follow.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// there is no question audio anywhere in Part 5, so there is no audio
// field here and the prompt is required.

// The answer review, the practice score and the end of part screen are
// not listed. They are the next ticket's work, and a kind that nothing
// can build and nothing can render would only be a claim that they
