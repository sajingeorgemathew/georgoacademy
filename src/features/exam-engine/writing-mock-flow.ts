// Screen order and answer helpers for the Mock Test 1 Writing section
// (EXAM-25).
//
// The Writing counterpart of reading-section-flow.ts. Pure functions over
// WritingSectionContent, no React and no side effects, so the flow can be
// built on the server, rendered on the client, and tested on its own
// later.
//
// The order is derived from the content rather than typed out, so a
// section with a different number of tasks needs no edit here. For Mock
// Test 1 it produces 5 screens:
//
//    1  Writing section intro
//    2  Writing Task 1, the situation, the prompt and the editor
//    3  Task 1 to Task 2 transition
//    4  Writing Task 2, the survey, the two positions and the editor
//    5  Writing section complete
//
// There is no score screen and no review screen, which is the whole shape
// of this ticket: nothing is marked, nothing is sent to an AI reviewer,
// and no band is estimated. The section closes on a completion screen
// that reports the two word counts and says the review is next. EXAM-26
// is where a result screen goes, and the note at the foot of
// docs/product/writing-mock-test-prototype.md says how.
//
// There is also no answer key helper here, and no withoutWritingAnswerKey
// to match the Reading one. A Writing task has no key: it is judged
// against descriptors rather than compared to a correct option, so there
// is nothing in the content that has to be kept out of the browser. The
// whole section content is safe to hand to the client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
