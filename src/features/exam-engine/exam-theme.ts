// Class recipes for the mock test player screen bodies (EXAM-01,
// re-scoped by EXAM-UI-02).
//
// Same idea as src/features/design/design-tokens.ts: every value is a
// Tailwind class string, and the raw colours stay in src/app/globals.css.
//
// **What is in this file and what is not** (EXAM-UI-02). The player chrome
// moved out, to mock-test-player-theme.ts beside this one: the desk, the
// centred window, the two bars, the content pane, the buttons, the timer
// badge, the split pane and the question panel all live there now. What is
// left here is what a screen body is built from, which is instruction
// rows, media, audio and video, question lists, passages, editors, review
// tables and score cards.
//
// The split is worth keeping. Chrome answers "how wide is the exam window
// and where does the scrollbar go", and there should be exactly one place
// that decides it. Screen recipes answer "what does a Part 5 question look
// like", and there are forty of those.
//
// **Colour.** The recipes are written against the academy-* palette
// tokens, and inside the player those tokens are re-pointed to the neutral
// player ramp by the [data-mock-test-player] rule in globals.css. So a
// recipe reading bg-academy-navy-soft draws in the brand ink tint on an
// internal preview page and in the player grey inside a mock test, without
// the recipe knowing which. That is how the ticket's separation of brand
// UI from exam UI is enforced in one place rather than forty.
//
// **Typography** (EXAM-UI-02). Every size in this file moved up one step:
// body copy from 13 to 15 pixels, secondary copy from 12 to 14, labels and
// captions from 11 to 12, and screen headings to 18. The engine was
// written at toolbar sizes, which was legible on the internal preview
// pages it was built against and too small to sit a two hour test in. The
// brief asks for 15 to 17 body, 16 to 18 for task instructions and 18 to
// 22 for a section title, and that is what these now are.
//
// The exam surface intentionally looks different from the dashboard. It
// uses square corners instead of pill controls, tight chrome, and no
// cards or badges, so it reads as a focused test environment.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

//   density.

//   learner scroll their own writing to reread it. It is resizable
//   vertically as well, because a writer who wants more room should be

//   controls and the player sit in one bordered panel, so a learner
//   always knows where the recording lives on the screen and never has to
//   hunt for the Stop button.
// - **Recording is announced by a dot, not by red chrome.** A recording
//   panel turns its status dot red and leaves everything else alone. The
//   alternative, washing the panel in red, reads as an error, and
//   recording is the normal case.
// - **An error is a bordered notice with its own control.** A microphone
