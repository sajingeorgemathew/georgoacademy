// Learner facing wording for the Listening screens (EXAM-03).
//
// Same rule as exam-copy.ts: all Listening chrome copy lives in one file
// so the screens say the same thing everywhere, and so a wording change
// is one edit rather than six.
//
// Two things this file deliberately does not copy from the source
// document:
//
// - "You will hear the conversation only once" and "You will hear it only
//   once". This prototype lets a clip be replayed, so printing the
//   official-style sentence would be a promise the screen does not keep.
//   The one time playback rule arrives with a later ticket, and the
//   sentence comes back with it.
// - The source break line for the third section reads "second" in both
//   places, which mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-content-outline.md
//   records as a copy and paste slip in the document. The ordinal is
//   generated here instead, so the third break reads "third".
//
// Strings and pure helpers only, no side effects, so this file is safe to
// import from a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// Shown under a one screen question list while questions are
// outstanding, explaining why Next is not available yet.
//
// Held as a module constant because two entries below read it: the
// dropdown parts and the video discussion part say the same sentence, and
// two literals would be two things to keep in step. Named per screen kind
// rather than shared under one key so a later wording change can be made
// for one and not the other without a rename.
