// Pure helpers for the reusable exam countdown timer (EXAM-15D).
//
// No React and no side effects. Every calculation here takes the current
// time as an argument rather than reading it, which is what makes the
// countdown testable: the whole of it can be checked by passing a made up
// clock in.
//
// One function is the exception, openExamTimerDeadline, and it reads the
// clock because it has to be the thing that starts a window. It lives here
// rather than in the hook because react-hooks/purity refuses a Date.now
// call written inside a component or hook body, useState initialiser
// included. Moving it behind a plain module function is not a way around
// the rule: the rule is about a value that changes between renders leaking
// into render output, and a lazy initialiser runs once per mount, so this
// is the case the rule is drawing a line around rather than the case it is
// aimed at.
//
// Accuracy. A countdown that subtracts one every interval drifts, because
// an interval is a request rather than a promise: a backgrounded tab, a
// busy main thread or a laptop lid closing all delay ticks, and every
// delayed tick is a second the display never loses. So the timer stores an
// absolute deadline and works the remaining time out from the current
// time on every tick. A pause simply means the next tick shows a smaller
// number, which is the truth, rather than the clock running slow.
//
// The same shape is already used by the Writing and Speaking practice
// timers in src/features/writing/writing-timer.ts and
// src/features/speaking/timer-utils.ts. Those two are practice flows with
// their own screens and are not touched by this ticket, so this file is
// the exam engine's own copy of the idea rather than an import across a
// feature boundary. If the exam engine ever absorbs those flows, this is
// the file they collapse into.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
