// behaviour along with it. Same rule the EXAM-01 shell types and the
// EXAM-02 instruction screen types follow.
//
// The shapes here describe one Listening part, which is the unit the
// prototype renders. A full Listening section is six of these, and a full
// practice test is four sections. Neither is built yet.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
