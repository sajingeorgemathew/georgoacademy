// Learner facing wording for the Mock Test 1 Speaking section (EXAM-27,
// extended by EXAM-28).
//
// Same rule as exam-copy.ts, listening-copy.ts, reading-copy.ts and
// writing-mock-copy.ts: all Speaking mock test chrome copy lives in one
// file so the screens say the same thing everywhere, and so a wording
// change is one edit rather than seventeen.
//
// Four wording rules this file exists to hold the line on:
//
// - Nothing here promises an official result. EXAM-28 added a
//   transcription step, an AI review and an estimated Speaking level, so
//   the screens no longer say a review is coming later. What they say
//   instead is that the estimate is a CELPIP Decoded practice estimate
//   produced by AI-supported feedback. The words "official CELPIP
//   score", "official result", "guaranteed score" and "pass guarantee"
//   appear nowhere in this file except in the sentences that deny them.
// - Nothing here claims the review heard the recording. It did not. The
//   recording is transcribed and the scoring model is given the
//   transcript, the task, the recording window and the measured
//   duration. So no sentence in this file says the review judged
//   pronunciation, rhythm or intonation, and the audio assessment note
//   says in words that it did not.
// - Nothing here says a recording has been saved. It has not. Every
//   recording lives in the browser tab and is lost on a reload, and it
//   leaves the page only for the length of one review request. The intro
//   notice, the line under the recorder, the submit hint and the
//   completion notice all say so.
// - Nothing here names the official test as the thing the learner is
//   sitting. This is CELPIP Decoded practice software, which is the rule
//   docs/product/exam-engine-reference-audit.md section 9 sets out.
//
// What is deliberately not copied from the source document. The Mock Test
// 1 Speaking instructions are five sentences, and three of them describe
// software that behaves differently from ours:
//
//   "In this practice test, no score will be provided for any of the
//   Speaking tasks. However, you can refer to the Performance Standards
//   for Speaking or listen to sample speaking responses at the end of the
//   Speaking Test."
//   "For this practice test, you should use a timer to make sure that you
//   complete each task within the given time."
//   "The practice test will not record your answers. If you wish to
//   record your own answers, record and save your responses using your
//   computer microphone or your own recording device."
//
// This engine has its own preparation and recording countdowns, so the
// learner does not need a timer of their own. It records in the browser,
// so the third sentence is not true here. And it has no sample responses
// screen and no Performance Standards link, so the first sentence points
// at something that does not exist in this product.
//
// docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md already flagged this as work to
// do: "Rewrite the Speaking instruction copy so it describes Toronto
// Academy behaviour". The instruction lines below are that rewrite. The
// two facts in the source instructions that are true here, that you move
// forward by pressing Next and that the Speaking Test is about 15
// minutes, are both kept.
//
// The eight task prompts are not in this file. Those are source content
// and live in
// src/features/exam-engine/mock-tests/mock-test-1/speaking-section.ts.
//
// Strings and pure helpers only, no side effects, so this file is safe to
// import from a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
