// The Speaking windows, and where every number in them came from
// (EXAM-27).
//
// Speaking is the only section in the engine with two clocks on one
// screen, and it is the section whose timings are hardest to source, so
// they get a file of their own rather than being typed into the content
// file eight times over.
//
// Where the numbers came from
// ---------------------------
//
// The Mock Test 1 source document,
// `mock-tests/mock-test-1/Mock Test 1 -Sajinlinks.docx`, publishes one
// Speaking timing and only one:
//
//   Try to complete this practice Speaking Test in 15 minutes.
//
// It publishes no per-task figure in words. Three of its prompt images do
// carry a preparation countdown in the picture: the Task 3 and Task 4
// images show "Preparation Time 29" and the Task 8 image shows
// "Preparation Time 30", which is a 30 second preparation window caught
// mid tick.
//
// The per-task pairs below come from the official Speaking overview,
// `public/Overview and Scoring Descriptors/4. Speaking/Speaking -
// Overview.pdf`, read and recorded as a table in
// `docs/product/celpip-exam-rules-research.md` section 5. That research
// document is the project's transcription of a scanned PDF, so the
// figures are labelled "reference" rather than "published": a real
// source, but not one printed in the Mock Test 1 file.
//
// A disagreement, recorded rather than resolved
// ---------------------------------------------
//
// `docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md` also holds a timing table,
// read from screenshots, and it disagrees with the research table on two
// tasks: it gives Task 6 a 30 second preparation where the research gives
// 60, and Task 7 a 60 second recording where the research gives 90.
//
// The research table is used here, for three reasons. It names its source
// as the official Speaking overview, while the content map calls its own
// table "values read from the screenshots, for reference only" and lists
// confirming them as an open task. It is per-task rather than grouped, so
// it distinguishes tasks the screenshot table lumps together. And it adds
// up: the eight preparation windows total 5 minutes and the eight
// recording windows total 9 minutes, which is 14 minutes of clock inside
// the 15 minutes the source document publishes for the Speaking Test. The
// content map's figures total 13 minutes, which leaves two minutes of the
// published allowance unaccounted for.
//
// The check is in code below, not only in this comment: see
// sumSpeakingSectionSeconds and SPEAKING_SECTION_PUBLISHED_SECONDS.
//
// Task 5 is the one window that is not a straight copy. The research
// table reads "60 seconds (x2)" for its preparation, because the official
// task runs across two screens with 60 seconds of preparation on each.
// This prototype gives Task 5 one screen and therefore one preparation
// window of 60 seconds. That is a deliberate simplification of a source
// figure rather than an invention of one, and it is written up in
// docs/product/speaking-mock-test-prototype.md.
//
// What these windows do and do not do
// -----------------------------------
//
// They count, they change colour, and at zero they read "Time is up".
// Nothing else. Reaching zero does not start a recording, stop one, erase
// one, advance a screen or call anything. The learner continues by
// pressing Next when they are ready. That is what the ticket asks a
// prototype timer to do, and strict Speaking timing is a later ticket.
//
// Pure values and pure functions, no React and no side effects, so this
// file is safe to import from a server component or a client component.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
