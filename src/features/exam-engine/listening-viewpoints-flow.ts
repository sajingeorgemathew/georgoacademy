// Screen order and answer helpers for a viewpoints Listening part
// (EXAM-13).
//
// The counterpart of listening-flow.ts, listening-dropdown-flow.ts and
// listening-video-flow.ts, for the part built around one report clip whose
// statements are completed from radio options. Pure functions over
// ListeningViewpointsPartContent, no React and no side effects, so the
// flow can be built on the server, rendered on the client, and tested on
// its own later.
//
// The flow is short and fixed, because the shape of the part is fixed: one
// clip and one question screen, however many questions the part has. For
// Mock Test 1 Listening Part 6 it produces five screens:
//
//   1  part intro
//   2  scenario
//   3  report audio
//   4  all six viewpoints questions
//   5  part complete
//
// It is still built rather than typed out inline, so the ids come from the
// content object and the prototype cannot drift from the flow.
//
// It ends on a single completion screen because the Part 6 answer review
// and practice score are not built yet. That is the ending EXAM-09 shipped
// for Part 4 and EXAM-11 shipped for Part 5, and in both cases the next
// ticket added the three closing screens behind an ending option rather
// than changing what the default call returns. The Part 6 review ticket
// should do the same: add ListeningViewpointsFlowEnding with "review" and
// "complete", make "review" the default, and leave "complete" available
// for a part that ships before its review exists.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// as serialized data, so a key handed down that way is readable by anyone
// who opens the network panel. Mock Test 1 Listening Part 6 has a
// complete, confirmed key, so its route strips it here before rendering.
//
// Everything else is passed through untouched, including the answer sheet
// image reference, which is a URL rather than a transcribed answer and is
// rendered nowhere in this ticket.
//
// This is not a substitute for marking on the server. It keeps the answers
// off the page for a prototype that does no marking. The screen that marks
// answers has to do the comparison where the key lives, which is what the
// Part 2 to Part 5 server actions do, and what the Part 6 review ticket
// should add beside the Part 6 route.
