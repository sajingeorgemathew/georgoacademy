// Types for the Reading part content and the Reading screen flow
// (EXAM-16).
//
// This file holds types only, no runtime values, so it can be imported
// from a server component or a client component without pulling any
// behaviour along with it. Same rule the EXAM-01 shell types, the EXAM-02
// instruction screen types and the four Listening type files follow.
//
// The shapes here describe one Reading part, which is the unit the
// prototype renders. A full Reading section is four of these, and neither
// the section nor the review that closes it is built yet.
//
// What is different about Reading, and why this is a new shape rather
// than a Listening shape reused:
//
// - A Reading part has no media at all. There is no clip, no poster and
//   no running time, so every media field in the Listening shapes would
//   be dead here.
// - A Reading part is one screen, not a sequence. Screen type 8 in
//   docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md is a split screen: the
//   passage on the left with its own scrollbar, the questions on the
//   right with theirs. Everything a learner needs is on it at once.
// - A Reading part's questions arrive in groups. Reading Part 1 has two:
//   six questions about the message, then five blanks inside a written
//   reply to it. The groups carry their own instruction line and the
//   second one carries the reply text, so a group is a real part of the
//   content rather than a display grouping.
// - A Reading part is timed once, for the whole part. Listening times a
//   screen because Listening screens are handed out one at a time. See
//   ReadingPartTimer below.
//
// What is shared is imported rather than copied: the instruction bullet
// shape comes from instruction-screen-types.ts, the same way every
// Listening content type takes it.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

import type { ExamInstruction } from "./instruction-screen-types";

// One answer choice under a Reading question.
//
// The id is what the answer map stores, never the option text, so the
// wording can be corrected later without invalidating a stored answer.
// Same rule as ListeningOption and its three siblings.
export type ReadingOption = {
  id: string;
  text: string;
};

// One Reading question.
//
// Reading Part 1 has two kinds of question and this one type covers both,
// because the only difference between them is whether the question prints
// a stem:
//
// - A stem question, questions 1 to 6 in Part 1, is an incomplete
//   sentence answered from a drop-down. The stem is stored split around
//   its blank as textBefore and textAfter, the way
//   ListeningDropdownQuestion stores one, so the screen decides how the
//   blank is drawn and no component has to parse a sentence.
// - A response blank, questions 7 to 11 in Part 1, has no stem of its
//   own. The sentence it completes is in the reply text above the list,
//   and the source document prints nothing beside the number but the four
//   options. textBefore is unset for those, and the list draws the number
//   alone.
//
// The two are not separate types because they are marked identically, sit
// in the same answer map, and would otherwise force every consumer to
// switch on a discriminator that changes nothing but one line of layout.
// EXAM-18 added a third shape to the two above, because Reading Part 2
// asks three whole questions rather than three sentence stems:
//
// - A whole question, questions 6 to 8 in Part 2, is a complete sentence
//   ending in a question mark, for example "What is Gerry's relationship
//   to Charlie?". It has no blank anywhere in it, so splitting it around
//   one would mean inventing a stem the source document does not have. It
//   is stored whole, in text, and the list prints it with no blank drawn.
//
// text and textBefore are mutually exclusive in practice: a question is
// either a stem with a blank in it or a whole sentence without one. They
// are two optional fields rather than a discriminated union for the same
// reason the first two shapes share one type: the difference changes one
// line of layout and nothing else, and a discriminator would force every
// consumer to switch on it.
export type ReadingQuestion = {
  id: string;
  // Position inside the part, counting from 1 and continuous across the
  // groups. Reading Part 1 runs 1 to 11, so its second group starts at 7.
  // Display only, and it is also what the reply text points at.
  number: number;
  // A whole question, printed as it stands with no blank drawn. Set on a
  // question the source document writes as a complete sentence, which is
  // Reading Part 2 questions 6 to 8.
  text?: string;
  // Stem text up to the blank. Unset for a question whose sentence lives
  // in the response text rather than in the question.
  textBefore?: string;

  // is every stem question in Mock Test 1 Reading Part 1.
  textAfter?: string;

  // question. The part level answerKey list wins where both exist. Mock
  // Test 1 Reading Part 1 uses the list, so this stays unset there.

// One paragraph of a passage.
//
// A plain string. Passages are prose and carry no inline controls, so
// nothing more structured is needed on the left hand side.
export type ReadingPassageParagraph = string;

// One labelled section of a passage (EXAM-20).
//
// Reading Part 3 is the paragraph matching part: its passage is not four
// paragraphs of running prose but four labelled paragraphs, A to D, plus
// a fixed fifth entry E that is not a paragraph at all but the option a
// learner picks when the information is in none of them. Every question
// in the part is answered by naming one of those labels, so the label is
// content rather than decoration: it is the thing being selected, and a
// learner who cannot tell where paragraph B ends and C begins cannot
// answer the part.
//
// So a section is a label and the paragraphs under it, rather than a
// string with "A." typed on the front. The label stays a separate field
// for two reasons: the screen can draw it as a marker beside the text
// instead of running it into the first sentence, and nothing has to
// parse a paragraph to find out what it is called.
//
// paragraphs is a list rather than a single string because a labelled
// section is a section, not a paragraph. Mock Test 1 gives each of A to E
// exactly one paragraph, so every list here has one entry, and a part
// whose paragraph B runs to two would need no type change.
//
// This is an addition beside ReadingPassage.paragraphs rather than a
// replacement for it. Reading Parts 1 and 2 have no labelled sections and
// are untouched by it.

//
// Reading Part 2 is the diagram part: what the questions are answered
// from is a course brochure image, not prose, and the source document
// gives it as one Cloudinary URL rather than as text. So the left column
// needs a picture, and this is the shape it takes.
//
// alt is required rather than optional. A decorative picture would be one
// thing, but this one is the passage: a learner who cannot see it cannot
// answer the part, so there is no case where an empty alt is right and no
// reason to let a content file forget one.
// width and height are the file's intrinsic pixel size, and they are
// required for the same reason alt is. They go on the img element, so the
// browser reserves the right box from the ratio before the file arrives
// and the question column beside it does not jump when it loads. A
// content file that has the URL has the file, so there is no case where
// the size is unknowable.

// rather than a letter simply omits them.

// is stored split around its blank: the screen decides how a blank is
// drawn, and nothing has to parse a sentence at render time.

// email rather than a letter, and the source document prints three header
// lines above the salutation, the subject and the two addresses. They are

//
// The window travels with the content rather than living in a timing
