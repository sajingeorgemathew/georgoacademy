// Types for the instruction and instructional video screens (EXAM-02).

// instructional text screen that opens every section and part, and the
// instructional video screen that follows the section instructions.
//
// This file holds types only, no runtime values, so it can be imported
// from a server component or a client component without pulling any
// behaviour along with it. The same rule the EXAM-01 shell types follow.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// The five instruction and video groups the practice test engine has.
//
// overview is the whole test walkthrough shown once at the start of a
// full practice test. The other four are the section groups, and each one
// has its own instruction screen and its own instructional video.

// adds a bold lead in for a bullet that needs one, for example
// { heading: "Timing", text: "Each part has its own time limit." }.

// src is the raw public path, exactly as the file sits on disk, because
// that is what a reader can match against the file system. The player
// makes it URL safe, so a file name containing spaces still loads. See
// resolveExamMediaSrc in instructional-video-assets.ts.
//
// poster and durationLabel are optional because neither exists for the
// current local files. An invented running time would be wrong on screen,
// so an unset value shows nothing rather than a guess.
