// Types for a dropdown completion Listening part (EXAM-09).
//
// Screen type 7 in docs/product/exam-engine-screen-types.md: one media
// item, then every question for the part on a single screen, each an
// incomplete statement with a dropdown where the blank falls. Listening
// Parts 4, 5 and 6 all work this way. Only Part 4 is built.
//
// This is a separate shape from ListeningPartContent in
// listening-types.ts rather than a widening of it, and the difference is
// not cosmetic:
//
// - Parts 1 to 3 interleave conversation sections and question screens,
//   so their content is a list of sections each holding its own
//   questions. Part 4 has one clip and one flat question list, so a
//   sections array would always have exactly one entry and would say
//   nothing.
// - Parts 1 to 3 speak their questions and print nothing, so a question
//   there is an audio URL plus options. A question here is printed text
//   split around a blank and has no clip of its own.
// - The flows differ. Parts 1 to 3 walk one question per screen and gate
//   Next on that one answer. Part 4 shows all five at once and gates Next
//   on the whole set.
//
// Merging the two would produce a type where half the fields are unset
// for any given part, so they stay apart. What they do share is imported
// rather than copied: the scenario shape, the instruction bullet shape,
// and the answer key entry.
//
// This file holds types only, no runtime values, so it can be imported
// from a server component or a client component without pulling any
// behaviour along with it. The helpers live in
// listening-dropdown-flow.ts. Same rule listening-types.ts follows.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// The id is what the answer map stores, never the option text, so the
// wording can be corrected later without invalidating a stored answer.

// One completion question: an incomplete statement and the choices that
// finish it.
//
// The statement is stored split around the blank rather than as one
// string with a placeholder in it, so the screen decides how the blank is
// drawn and no component has to parse a sentence. In Mock Test 1 Part 4
// every blank ends its statement, so textAfter is unset throughout, but
// Parts 5 and 6 have blanks mid sentence and will use it.

  // statement.

  // Correct option id, for a part whose key is written question by
  // question. The part level answerKey list below wins where both exist.
  // Mock Test 1 Part 4 uses the list, so this stays unset there.

// The single media item a dropdown part is built around.
//
// url is a clip for Part 4 and Part 6 and a video for Part 5, which is
// why the field is not named audioUrl. Only the audio case is built.

  // Running time as text, for example "About 1.5 minutes". Display only,
  // and taken from the source document rather than measured.

  // For example "mock-test-1".

  // Answer key for the whole part, one entry per question.
  //
  // Optional, because a part can be built and walked through before its
  // key exists. An entry with correctOptionId null is a question whose
  // key is known to be missing.
  //
  // A complete key must never reach the browser. See
  // withoutListeningDropdownAnswerKey in listening-dropdown-flow.ts.

// One screen in a dropdown part flow.
//
// A discriminated union rather than a screen index, for the same reason
// ListeningScreen is one: adding a screen kind should be a compile error
// everywhere it matters.
//
// Shorter than ListeningScreen because the shape of the part is simpler.
// There is one media screen and one question screen, neither of which
// needs an index, so no screen here points back into the content.
