// Types for the Mock Test 1 Writing section prototype (EXAM-25).
//
// The Writing counterpart of reading-section-types.ts. A Writing section
// is two tasks rather than four parts, and a task is answered by typing
// prose rather than by choosing an option, so this is a new shape rather
// than a Reading type with the questions removed.
//
// What a Writing task carries that a Reading part does not:
//
// - a situation to read, which the source prints in a panel headed
//   "Read the following information."
// - a prompt instruction and a list of requirements, which is what the
//   response is judged against later
// - a word target, 150 to 200 words in both Mock Test 1 tasks
// - for Task 2 only, a set of positions to choose between before writing
//
// What it deliberately does not carry: an answer key, a score, a band, or
// anything an AI reviewer would need. Writing is not marked against a key
// and nothing in this ticket marks it at all. EXAM-26 adds the review.
//
// Types only, no runtime values, so this can be imported from a server
// component or a client component without pulling behaviour along with
// it. The same rule reading-types.ts and reading-section-types.ts follow.
// The helpers live in writing-mock-flow.ts and the wording in
// writing-mock-copy.ts.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

import type {
  ExamInstruction,
  ExamSectionIntroDetail,
} from "./instruction-screen-types";

// Where a timing figure came from.
//
// The same three values ReadingTimerSource draws, and for the same
// reason: a screen with a clock on it has to be able to say whether the
// number is published, worked out from published numbers, or a working
// stand in. See the timer note in
// docs/product/writing-mock-test-prototype.md.
export type WritingTimerSource = "published" | "derived" | "placeholder";

// The writing window for one task.
//
// Writing is timed per task in the Mock Test 1 source: its Writing
// instructions give 53 minutes for the section and name 27 minutes as the
// point at which the official test moves from Task 1 to Task 2. The
// window travels with the task content for the same reason the Reading
// window travels with the part: there is one number per task and it is a
// property of that task.

  // nowhere: it is here so a reader of the content file does not have to
  // go looking.
  note: string;
};

// The prompt as the source document holds it.
//
// Both Mock Test 1 Writing prompts exist in the source only as Cloudinary
// images, which is what mock-tests/mock-test-1/extracted-links.md records
// and what docs/product/mock-test-1-content-map.md lists as a content gap.
// The text on this task's screens is transcribed from that image, and the
// image itself is kept here so a reader can check the transcription
// against the original.
//

  // do not depend on this: everything in the image is also on the screen
  // as text.

// One position a learner can take before writing, on a task that offers a
// choice.
//
// Mock Test 1 Writing Task 2 is the survey task, so it offers two: the
// source prints them as "Option A" and "Option B" with a sentence each.
// label is the bold lead in and text is the sentence, kept apart so the
// screen can weight them the way the source does.
export type WritingTaskOption = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  text: string;

// The word count guidance for a task, for example 150 to 200 words.

// response, a long one, or an empty one: the count is shown beside the
// editor and the target is shown beside the count.

  taskTitle: string;

  // There is deliberately no instructions list, no summary and no format
  // label on a task.
  //
  // The Reading part type carries all three because a Reading part opens
  // on its own intro screen. A Writing task has no intro screen: the flow
  // the ticket asks for is intro, Task 1, transition, Task 2, complete,
  // so a learner arrives at a task screen with the source's own
  // instruction lines already in front of them, in the situation panel
  // and the prompt panel below. Fields for a screen that does not exist
  // would have to be filled with something, and the only wording
  // available to fill them with would be invented.

  // The situation panel on the left of the task screen.
  //
  // situationInstruction is the source's own lead line, "Read the
  // following information." situationHeading is the bold line above the

  // 2's survey name.

// to build.
