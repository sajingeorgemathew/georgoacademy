// Prompt construction for the Mock Test 1 Speaking review (EXAM-28).
//
// Two builders and the checklists they draw on. No network, no secrets,
// no OpenAI client: this file turns content plus transcripts into two
// strings, which is what makes the wording reviewable on its own and
// checkable without a paid call.
//
// It is separate from src/features/speaking/scoring-prompt.ts on
// purpose, and that separation is the point rather than duplication.
// The standalone Speaking Practice evaluator scores one task against
// categories of its own and returns numeric scores that are saved to
// attempt_scores. This one reviews a whole eight task section against
// the four CELPIP Speaking criteria, returns levels as text, and saves
// nothing. Reusing the standalone prompt would mean changing it, and
// changing it would change every standalone result that has already been
// produced. So the standalone file is left exactly as it is.
//
// The evaluator rules below are the ones supplied for this ticket: four
// criteria with Listenability third, conservative levelling, Task
// Fulfillment weighed heavily, and a task specific checklist for each of
// the eight CELPIP Speaking task types. They are stated in the system
// prompt rather than assumed, because a model that is not told to be
// conservative will not be.
//
// The honesty rules are the other half of this file's job. The scoring
// model receives a transcript, not a waveform, so it is told in the
// system prompt what it may and may not claim: it can read hesitation,
// repair and repetition out of a faithful transcript, and it cannot hear
// pronunciation, rhythm or intonation. A model that is not told that
// will write "your intonation was flat" from a text file.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
