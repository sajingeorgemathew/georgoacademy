// Class recipes for the Mock Test 1 player chrome (EXAM-UI-02).
//
// Same idea as exam-theme.ts beside this file: every value is a Tailwind
// class string and the raw colours live in src/app/globals.css. What is
// different is the job.
//
// exam-theme.ts holds the recipes a screen body is built from, which is
// question lists, passages, editors, review tables and score cards.
// This file holds the recipes the window around them is built from, which
// is the desk, the frame, the two bars, the content pane, the buttons, the
// timer badge and the split pane.
//
// Why the split matters. The player chrome is the part of the test that a
// learner never reads and always sees, so it has to be the part that
// stops looking like a product. Keeping it in its own file means the
// question of "how wide is the exam window" has exactly one answer, in one
// place, rather than being an emergent property of forty screen recipes.
//
// The palette is the player ramp, not the CELPIP Decoded brand:
//
//   player-desk         the grey the exam window sits on
//   player-chrome       the compact top and bottom bars
//   player-line         the window border and internal rules
//   player-paper        the white content area
//   player-ink          body text
//   player-blue         the primary exam action
//
// Legal note. Nothing here is taken from any official test provider. The
// window is a plain grey and white application frame, there is no official
// logo anywhere in it, the primary action is an ordinary interface blue
// rather than an official blue-red pairing, and no footer carries anyone
// else's copyright line. This is an original practice simulator skin.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.

// The desk, the centred container, and the exam window itself.
//
// Three levels, and each one is answering a specific complaint from the
// EXAM-UI-02 brief.
//
// **desk** is the grey the window sits on. It grows to fill whatever
// height its parent has, which inside the locked player viewport is the
// browser window and on an ordinary page is nothing at all. That is the
// same deliberately inert height request the old frame made, and it is
// what lets one set of classes serve both places.
//
// **container** is the width cap and the margins. max-w-[1100px] is the
// middle of the 1040 to 1120 band the brief asks for, and it is the whole
// answer to the test feeling stretched: on a wide monitor the window stops
// growing and the desk takes the rest. 40 pixels of desk above and 32
// below, which is the band the brief asks for.
//
// It grows rather than asking for a percentage of the desk, so the height
// chain from the viewport to the content pane is pure flex and nothing in
// it depends on a percentage resolving against a stretched parent.
//
// **window** is the frame. A light grey border, small corners, a hairline
// shadow, and overflow-hidden so the two bars clip the content pane rather
// than the content pane pushing past them. min-h-[34rem] is a floor, not a
// height: on a very short window the desk scrolls instead of the bars
// being crushed.

// - **the marker is grey, not blue.** A blue bullet in front of blue text
//   reads as a second emphasis on a screen that already has one. Grey
//   marks the row and gets out of the way.
// - **rows are ruled and 16 pixels.** A hairline under each rule keeps a
//   full set of Listening instructions on one screen without white space

//
// - **hover is a pale green wash**, player-green-soft. It is the lightest
//   tint in the ramp, it never appears anywhere else on a question
//   screen, and it says "the pointer is here" and nothing more.
// - **selected is a warm wash**, player-orange-soft with an orange
//   hairline ring. Warm rather than green, so a row under the pointer and
//   a row already chosen can be told apart at a glance while both are on
//   screen, which is the thing a single hue in two strengths cannot do.
// - **neither state is loud.** Both are pale on purpose. A saturated wash
//   on a test screen reads as feedback about the answer, and a practice
//   test must never say "this one is right" before marking. Nothing here
//   knows the key: these are pointer and choice states, not results.
// - **rows are ruled, not spaced**. A hairline between options is what
//   keeps four options compact enough that a whole question fits above
//   the fold, and it is what an exam layout does.
//
// EXAM-UI-05 flipped the pair. Until this ticket hover was neutral grey
// and chosen was green here, while the Writing Task 2 positions used
// green hover and a warm chosen row, so the same gesture painted two
// different colours depending on which section a learner was in. One pair
// now runs through Listening, Reading, the drop-down menus and Writing.

// - **the trigger is compact and inline.** It sits in the sentence where

// writing, and it is what keeps the block compact enough that the prompt
// above it stays on screen.
