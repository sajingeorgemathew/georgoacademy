// Learner facing wording for scored attempt access (USAGE-01).
//
// All access copy lives here so the dashboard, the speaking and writing
// pages, and the blocked state say the same thing. Tone follows the rest
// of the app: professional Toronto Academy wording, no promises of
// unlimited free AI feedback and no official score language.
//
// House style: normal hyphens only, no long hyphens or em dashes.
//
// Strings only, no side effects, so this file is safe to import from a
// client component.

// existing way to reach the academy. There is no checkout yet, and this
// ticket does not build one.
