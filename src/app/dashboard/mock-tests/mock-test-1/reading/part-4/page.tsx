// Mock Test 1 Reading Part 4 prototype (EXAM-22).
//
// The three screen sequence for Reading Part 4: the part intro, the split
// screen holding the website article and all 10 questions, and the
// completion screen. There is no practice score and no answer review
// here, which is where the Reading Part 2 and Part 3 routes both started;
// EXAM-23 is what takes this one the rest of the way.
//
// This route runs in exam mode. It is listed in
// src/features/navigation/exam-mode-routes.ts, so the dashboard shell
// does not render its sidebar, header, breadcrumb trail or footer here,
// and ExamModeViewport gives the frame a fixed, one window tall viewport
// with document scrolling switched off. That is what the ticket's visual
// requirements ask for: a neutral exam background, a fixed top bar, fixed
// bottom navigation, and internal scrolling confined to the article
// column and the question column.
//
// It joins Reading Parts 1, 2 and 3 as an exam mode route for the same
// reason, and with one of its own. A Reading part is a split screen with
// a scrolling passage on one side and a scrolling question column on the
// other, and that screen cannot be judged, or used, inside the dashboard
// content column. Part 4 is the longest of the four: a five paragraph
// article on the left, and on the right five sentence stems plus a reader
// comment with five more blanks in it. Both columns have to scroll on
// their own for the part to be answerable at all.
//
// Because the exam surface carries no preview label, the caveats are said
// where a learner meets them. The part intro screen's notice says answers
// are held on the screen and nothing is saved, and the completion screen
// repeats it and says plainly that the review and the score are the next
// ticket. Nothing here shows a score, a CELPIP level or an estimated
// Reading band. A band is a reading of the whole section, and no part of
// this route marks anything at all.
//
// The route is not in navigation. It has one link, an Internal preview
// card in the Mock tests section of the dashboard, beside the Part 1,
// Part 2 and Part 3 cards, because an exam mode route carries no preview
// label of its own and pasting the URL was otherwise the only way in. The
// student facing Mock Test 1 card is untouched and still offers Listening
// only. Nothing anywhere offers a Reading test.
//
// The content is licensed Toronto Academy material, so the route sits
// under /dashboard where the layout auth guard covers it, and the page
// verifies the session again close to the content. No API route, no
// service role, and no write. Answers are held in the browser for the
// length of the visit and nothing is saved, to a database, to
// localStorage or to a cookie. The page carries robots noindex.
//
// withoutReadingAnswerKey is the same precaution the Reading Part 1, Part
// 2 and Part 3 routes and every Listening route take, and for the same
// reason. Reading Part 4 has a complete answer key printed in the source
// document and the prototype is a client component, so handing it the
// content object whole would ship 10 answers to the browser where anyone
// could read them out of the flight data. The key is stripped here, on
// the server, before the content crosses the boundary.
//
// There is no actions.ts beside this file, because nothing is marked yet.
// EXAM-23 should add one, holding a markReadingPartFour that reads the
// key from the content module on the server, the way markReadingPartOne,
// markReadingPartTwo and markReadingPartThree read theirs. Until then the
// key is stored and never read, and it crosses the boundary in neither
// direction. Nothing is saved, there is no attempt row and there is no
// migration.
