// instructional video for each of the four sections. All five local
// Toronto Academy clips are shown, so the whole instructional sequence
// can be reviewed in one place.
//
// The videos are real. Every line of instruction text on this page is
// placeholder copy written for the preview, because the real section
// instructions are not structured yet. No Mock Test 1 content, no
// question, no official screenshot, and no CELPIP branding appears here.
//
// This is not the practice test flow. Next, Back and Skip link between
// the samples on this page, nothing is saved, and nothing is scored. The
// flow tickets connect these screens to Mock Test 1.
//
// The route sits under /dashboard so the layout auth guard covers it, and
// the page verifies the session again. It is absent from navigation and
// carries robots noindex.
